179130	A laptop can easily work on 65 Watt. However, depending on the laptop, you might not get a very quick charge (or none at all) when you are working on it. A laptop AC adapter will first use wattage to power the laptop, and what is left will be used to charge the laptop battery. Ergo, if a laptop uses 60 Watt, with a 65 Watt power supply there is only 5 Watt left for charging, which really is not much.

91857	have you tried a stack trace against the offending app and sent it to the devs?	Well, the problem is that it happens at random, several days apart... i think that claiming 'Evolution has a race condition bug' based on one of your machines having an issue 'every few days' is a bit trigger-happy. i'm not saying Evolution does NOT have the bug, just that better triaging work has to be done before you can make definitive statements I've had that problem on more than one machine. But in any case, my point isn't against evolution. Bugs happen. My problem is that a bug in evolution can *effectively* bring my system down. a bug in any app on any OS can effectively bring the machine down. all OSes allow userspace apps access to swap. swap fills, performance tanks. c'est la vie.

60659	so can you walk me hrough how to do this?	that is correct. The normal partition system used does only allow 4 primary partitions. However, one of the primary can be an extended partition, which can contain several partitions. how do i do that? can i do that with a bootable partitio manager? usually, the fourth partition is created as extended partition. You can then continue to create as many as you want. In more userfriendly systems, you can chose between primary or logical when making partitions, and the system will do all the magic. But if you use logical partitions you can only have three primary (as the fourth contains the logical partitions) you can probably do it with all partition tools made for x86 the last 15 years 	CHAT

137205	can you suggest a better way to keep all server data, user data, logs, configuration in a way that they can be easily pulled off and stuck onto another box if ubuntu decides to take a nosedive (or I accidentally delete /etc again ;)) ? - I'm kind of a self-taught linux noob - It seems like there should be a more standard way of doing this	so you have /data/conf on an NFS share or something? or do you just rsync among your machines? I'm not 100% positive though but it seems like my current setup disagrees with aptitude somehow - for example update-manager is currently hung updating mysql /etc/init/mysql.conf ;) it shouldn't be messing with a conffile I would think /data/conf/ is just copied manually whenever I setup a new box - it just helps keep things in one place when things need fixing (frequently) - all the boxes serve as ldap/samba authentication servers too so all other local boxes work as thin clients and save all user data to /data/home/* on the main box (which is on a seperate raid drive) - seemed to me like the safest bet so what are you getting for an error message while updating? You may want to use command line tools for updating if you're not getting good feedback. 	CHAT

63821	reinstalling samba probably won't accomplish much since all the config files and databases will still hang around when you reinstall it. What you might want to try is deleting the contents of wherever samba stores its databases and whatnot and then restarting samba. I have no idea where those are on Linux though (on FreeBSD they're in /var/db/samba)	try running smbclient -L server -U accountonserver and seeing if you can get a list of shares from it that way thanks for your suggestion, but I'm not very good at command-lining, not sure what that line does, thus don't want to put the password of the user into it; maybe I'd rather try to reinstall samba if you confirm that this is a good idea and probably say how. what it does is prompt the server for a list of shares available to the account you specify. It's a quick way of determining if it's the server at fault or Nautilus filesystem virtualisation this is my fault, this issue happens for many machines on the LAN though no soft/hard ware changes occured on them.. that's why I'm inclined to reinstall samba - is this a good idea?

12542	can you please link me to the bug ?	although you and many might not, equally many, myself included, would base buying decisions on whether manufacturers are open with hardware-software interface specs. So if we can expose the situation, there may be a little more leverage. i don't disagree with your reasons, my point was nvidia not providing hardware specs is 'not beneficial' but it does not harm anyone i have always supported hardware manufacturers who provide specs and open drivers. I have purchased Matrox cards from 2000-2002, ATI 85xx amontg others. I am contemplating buying a GPS receiver for my laptop which has free drivers (heard about it from my neighbour) My conjecture is that it harms the community. Whether it directly harms a specific person is outside of my conjecture. But then again, I am harmed by the lack of hardware specifications. I need to buy a non-Nvidia add-in graphics card to use suspend to ram. That is harm. 	CHAT

94315	vi an mp3? that's a novel idea :) anyway, autocompletion was made 'smart' by default in Edgy or something. you can open ~/.bashrc and find where it says 'enable programmable completion features', and comment out the line between 'if' and 'fi'. however that will remove other features too, such as autocompletion after 'sudo' and autocompletion of command options. you might want to edit /etc/bash_completion to fit your tastes in more specific ways, i	type 'encrypted filesystem site:help.ubuntu.com' into google thanks :) hmm, although this seems to require knowing how much data i want apriori.  ideally i'd like to be able to copy and delete and have the file grow and shrink accordingly i've never really done that. you're a bit on your own i'm afraid, unless someone else chirps in. try #ubuntu-offtopic as well  okay, thanks 	CHAT

156265	anyway, you might want to file a bug (if there isn't one already) -- i don't see any reason why OBEX FTP shouldn't be mounted automatically like mass storage devices	oh, in that case, if the stuff you want to access is on Bluetooth, just type 'bluetooth:/' in Dolphin/Konqueror I use the USB, it's faster ;) and I don't have bluetooth in my laptop. I have added a obexfs line to /etc/fstab, so I can mount/umount /media/phone, but it would be fantastic if it was automatically discovered and mounted i agree that it probably would, but i honestly don't know how Ubuntu does it. and i don't know of any way to access OBEX FTP services that are on anything else than Bluetooth from KDE, either it's easy, you use -u instead of -b 'from KDE' 	CHAT

195241	can you post the archive somewhere so i can try it	ok you can always add it to your sources.list but the packages are not up-to-date and ubuntu no longer supports them one more thing, whenver i download some software from the internet using firefox in .zip or in .tar format, they download fine, but when i click on them on the desktop the icon of the archive (a box one) changes to one of html document. That means that the .zip file now has a html icon and behaves as one. Moreover, when i try to extract it nothing happens even when i extract it at the command line, somehow it becomes a html document magic that is new. i have never even heard of that happening unless it has an html doc inside the zipped archive no its a proper archive, and i can't extract it, that happens with quite a few archives that i download :( 	CHAT

239724	and so you might have to work around that, and the two ways are to backup the table and create a new one, or to convert from mbr->gpt->mbr	one headache you will have is that extended partition. you can shrink the ext4 and then move it back so that there is blank space between the end of sda2 and the start of sda5, but you cannot expand the sda2 without shrinking the extended a couple of approaches at that point would be to (a) take a backup of your partition table and then delete it, and recreate a new one that matches the current partition table exactly, but has the extended partition starting later alternately you could use a tool like gdisk to convert the mbr table to a gpt table and then convert from gpt back to mbr setting the extended partition as desired start by shrinking sda5. the shrink will happen at the end of sda5 leaving blank space between sda5 and sda6. then move sda5 so that it lines up with sda6. now you have blank space inside sda4 (its that extended container) then you would want to resize the extended partition (you shrunk the boxes inside the extended partition box so now you can shrink the extended partition box itself) but the tools might not let you do that 	CHAT

I have 5 outputs on my computer, 3 stereo cables leading from there to the 5.1 amp.  the former 5.1 settings didnt give a subwoofer signal, thats why attach the center channel to the sufwoofer...	depends on your computer's outputs. some have multiple outputs for multiple channels, others have just stereo output, and relies on the amplifier to route the sounds to the right places. but we're getting a bit beyond the scope of #ubuntu :) so, then what would the software output be if there are enough outputs on the computer it is a pre-question because i need to decide if I can go back to alsa without loosing my multichannel functionality well, for example, the laptop i'm on now has digital stereo and analog stereo outputs; under the pulseaudio sound preferences, i can select e.g. 'analog duplex output' or 'analog input, digital output' etc. I would guess that cards with multi-channel output would have multi-channel options. however, I think what you're asking is, can 2 channel stereo carry multi-channel (e.g. 5.1, 7.1 surround) signals? the answer is yes, because the amplifier decodes it 	CHAT

Does it give an error?	it is the proprietary binary driver that you are getting from the ATI/AMD web site How do I know those drivers are better then the ones that ATI offers? if you are getting anything else it is likely already installed (there is a 2d only driver called ati and the opensource radeon driver) I have been using nvida and ATI drivers for about 10 years.

166773	You have to tell the service you bought the domain name from to point 'something.example.com' at your public facing IP.  Because that IP is dynamic you can you dynDNS (I'm not sure about those details).  But usually these dynamic IPs rarely change in practice	If I already own a domain name for my website, can I use this? Yes If you own 'example.com' you can have hello.example.com point at a specific machine  Does it have to be entered in anywhere specific to 'set' it, or do I just start using it.  It just seems weird to me.  I have a web host out on the internet, and I have my own internal network with dynamic IP.  So something tells me I can't do this unless I use DynDNS or an equivalent service to an extent.  As you can see, I know bits and peices, but I don't feel like I've got the big picture grasped fully.  As for DNS servers, what do you think is the best option right now?  I see some sites mention bind, others mention djbdns, etc... 	CHAT

Either all four will start, two will and I get the segmentation failure for the other two, or all of them won't I have ati cards running all three.  Identical cards.

Pentium 4 2.8Ghz HT, 3gb DDR1 400MHz memory, running single-channel for now cause I found one of the 4 sticks were bad, 6 HDD's, DVD-ROM, DVD-RW, USB-based MMC/SD/MS/CF/SM drive, etc Keeping in mind, OpenSUSE, FreeBSD, even Fedora's installer, was blazing fast, it's just Ubuntu's that's running slow as molasses. so, pretty decent. hrm. the installer isn't exactly optimized for any specific system, so different systems, despite newer specs, can sometimes respond slow during the installation phase, especially if the hardware itself isn't configured to the kernel right - ever tried doing a pci=routeirq? and that's just on the one system? Yes, so far.. Though admittedly this is the only system yet I've done 8.04.3 on.

171024	but /var isnt like /home. Typically with /home/yourusername you might be able to just take that and copy it to another users and viola your settings are with you..no prob. but you cant just copy /var because there is a lot of system specific stuff in there which might not apply on another system.	i used to go crazy installing a dozen partitions now if i were using your setup I would do this: im using ubuntu as my only os and i want to install a distribution if i want to that way you have lots of storage for personal files and if you upgrade your /home can remain as it is those numbers are flexible of course. if you werent going to be writing dvds, you might make the /tmp smaller....if you are going to have a lot of activity on the computer (lots of users doing lots of things) you might make the /tmp larger a couple of reasons. Its going to contain /var and /usr etc, so if you install extra programs you have plenty of room to store them. Also a lot of programs like mysql store their stuff in /var so you have /var/lib/mysql/dbname if you end up installing mysql that gives you lots of room to play there 	CHAT

139737	if you're running it in a VM, you might want to install 10.04. It a LTS version so it's more stable,I've had issues running 11.10 in a VM since it's newer and not officially supported yet. In fact, I actually switched my VM to 10.04 last night.	agreed I agree with you completely, I think Ubuntu made a huge mistake in offering that desktop for all versions You should, once you select your name from the existing users, at the very bottom of the screen a couple menus will show up. There will be a couple different options, such as selecting your keyboard layout and whatnot. In the middle or right side, it should have one that lets you choose which desktop. If you select Ubuntu Classic, that should get rid of the launcher bar. I apologize, apparently Ubuntu 11.10 doesn't come with the classic desktop like 11.04 does, I had assumed it did. However, you do have the ability to install it, and it seems pretty easy. Try this link here, it gives a pretty good tutorial on how to do it. http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2011/09/11/install-the-classic-desktop-in-ubuntu-11-10/ it's not the end all, I've tried out KDE and like it a lot, it's up to  you, but if you used to use Ubuntu and liked how it used to be, get the classic ubuntu desktop 	CHAT

DeCaf: at least using a script and a running variable you can add in all ips manually. i am not sure if ifconfig directly supports IP ranges. I'll check.

Basically, create their users, and if you want to share with them, add everyone to some new group, make a new folder, make it owned by that group, etc. (actually, theres a hundred ways to set this up, just remember, its through regular permissions) yeah well, all of *your* files well, you can view files outside of the home folder from your regular account Basically, open up nautilus, everything you can browse to from there, you'll be able to browse through with sftp.

35041	can you tell me why it's saying 'somescript.sh: command not found'?	that's correct (assuming your writing a bash script) yep, also, does taking something as an 'argument' mean they have to input something? It says it needs to take the login name as an argument and output user directory. Or should it just output the directory when they run it? to run a script with the user name as the arg, you would do something like this: somescript.sh $USER so inside of my bash script file I would just put 'somescript.sh $USER' to take the login name as an argument and 'echo ~' beneath it? not sure about the echo, but you just use $USER as the value for the argument 	CHAT

I have added a obexfs line to /etc/fstab, so I can mount/umount /media/phone, but it would be fantastic if it was automatically discovered and mounted i agree that it probably would, but i honestly don't know how Ubuntu does it. and i don't know of any way to access OBEX FTP services that are on anything else than Bluetooth from KDE, either it's easy, you use -u instead of -b 'from KDE' 	CHAT

You should keep researching networking though.  Especially understanding about the firewall, and about proper and secure configuration of SSH tiself. Actually, dyndns or similar is best for when you are just getting started.  Once you are a nerd-god, you likely won't need such conveniences anymore.  ;) 	CHAT

I forgot about that, freaked out the first time I ever saw my CPU temps in Linux. hmm. Ok new experiment, going back to what I said earlier : the default ubuntu drivers won't be as shiny but they should do basic things like making the GPU run its fans and stuff right? That would be possible...you could also check which version of the drivers is currently recommended for 'nix too. But seriously, you may want to check out nvclock too. 	CHAT

One of my friends uses an ATI video card, and I use an nVidia video card at home. Whenever I go to install the ATI drivers, though, it wants to uninstall the nVidia drivers.

158562	Hello again. I found a solution to my problem. You can have Ubuntu ask for authorization when mounting devices, by changes the configuration in /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.udisks.policy. Simply find the mount options and change the 'allow_active' property from 'yes' to 'auth_admin' or 'auth_admin_keep'. Though you might want to know :)	But I still don't know how to have Ubuntu request a password when mounting USB devices Nope, just for one account Something to do with HAL I guess?? I think it would be fine to implement it in the Window Manager. I've disabled shell access. So perhaps somewhere in Gnome Try in system > administration > users and groups. Go to advanced settings and unchek the option 	CHAT

63530	One thing you might try is changing your server to use port 443 for SSH.

I don't want him to know that I use proxy tunneling to connect to the internent Well that will be quite difficult to do. Doing it via SSH he will see that you are making a secure connection, but nothing will prove that you are browsing the internet with it I think that's the best you will do if you are using your own server. If you use another proxy, he could look up the IP address and see that it's a proxy is there to your knowledge another way to do set this up in order to surf the internet without being traced? 	CHAT

To work around the bug you can create a small /boot partition near the beginning of the drive, or if it's an IDE drive you can also use grub2's native PATA drivers to bypass the BIOS. this was working before .. just restarted now What has happened is that grubs files were being stored before the limit of your BIOS before.

I think we are misunderstood. I didn't explain myself correctly. My system plays sounds just fine using the Motherboard integrated sound card. It's set up on ALSA because I modified the system from loading 'PulseAudio'. The system plays the system sounds normally, that is not the issue. The thing is that sometimes it uses the internal PC speakers for some 'Error' sounds instead of using the Integrated sound card. 	CHAT

I've found some information for it http://www.utstar.com/Products/Customer_Premise_Equipment/DSL_Modems/UT300R2U/ -- is that it? it seems that it can be set up as a router. If you can manage that, it'll be easy to use with Linux no, Windows will work with it as well, once it's set up as a router.

164186	so can you please tell me in few words what should I do because I am a noob. If it's too complicated I will just stay with this. I really don't mind it loading...	1: Installed ubuntu via 'wubi'. Then when I restart a loader appears but it's not grub. I think it windows'. I choose ubuntu and this appears: 'Try (hd0,0): NTFS5: No wubildr'. I wait for 30 seconds and grub appears. I choose Ubuntu and it's all ok but it takes me more than 1-2 minutes to boot.Can I change this(can grub load first) Yes, grub can be made to load first with Wubi, but if you want that you may just want to do a normal install instead. I wouldn't say that it's bad, but IMHO a normal install is better. IMHO it's too complicated to be worth it. th1: Just running grub-install /dev/sda within a wubi system won't actually install grub to the mbr, the 'lupin-support' package contains its own grub-install which overrides the normal one and just re-installs the wubildr file.

Installing NetworkManager disables my keyboard.   2.  Enabling compiz crashes GNOME   3. I can't install anything using apt because dpkg --configure -a needs to be run.  4. dpkg --configure -a doesn't want to finish successfully with fixing the problem.  So I'm stuck in a rut. This is the last f time I'm going to try Ubuntu on this laptop.  After that I'll just dump it into the trash can and install Vista back on it. 	CHAT

Ubuntu ships with a broken, old version of wine you need to persuade whatever emulator you're using to use a raw disk. with qemu this is easy, you just run qemu /dev/sda (with a few more options if you want them); with VirtualBox you need to create a vmdk file with the correct settings in it, which I don't know how to do 	CHAT

60825	- okay, could you clarify, please? Would ext2 & 3 have less write cycles than 4? And if so, why?	-  I've become accustomed to it and it's not really that bad, but when it comes to customising things, it's very easy to break stuff (as I have done frequently). - So now I've tried out UNR 9.10 and it blew my mind with awesomeness. - But - the only issue that I have is this story that I heard that Linpus was customised to the netbook in such a way that it minimises write cycles to the SSD, thereby prolonging the device lifetime. - I really want to use UNR, but not so keen on it if it might mean a shortened lifespan for my machine. Any opinions, facts, links? The only thing that I can think of would be the filesystem that it may have used.  You may want to look into using ext2 or ext3 (rather than ext4) when you do your install. 	CHAT

154804	right, you might try the xorg-edgers ppa, it has updated drivers. but i haven't seen the failure as you describe it here in a long while; the patches were pushed into the regular driver	any advice. The reason this seems strange to me is suspend had been working perfectly for about a year now. And it seems that even if I go back to older kernels, the issue persists yea i had some of my own problems like that; one was the intel video drive for a time, the rest was cgroup-bin; you should try going into the bios and using the 'restore defaults' thing, but figuring it out yourself you'll need more logging information I'll give that a try. It would be much easier to track down the issue if it happened consistently, but currently it just seems random. :/ yep, it's annoying; the intel thing was like that, are you running 10.04? I'm on 10.10. I do have an integrated intel video card though if that's what you're talking about 	CHAT

I've seen reports about a problem that shows up with the clock running fast and the cpu high otherwise it could just be that your motherboard has a cruddy clock (lots of them do) - installing ntp-server should help a lot i have ntp-server installed, but using /etc/init.d/ntp-server start does nothing my load average stays right around 0 most of the time more info, killing ntpd , running ntpdate, running ntpd then monitoring with ntpq shows steadily increasing offsets 	CHAT

If you're worried about brute force, you might want to look into something like DenyHosts, that'll lock someone out after they fail logging in X times.	That'll be through regular folder permissions.  Basically, create their users, and if you want to share with them, add everyone to some new group, make a new folder, make it owned by that group, etc. (actually, theres a hundred ways to set this up, just remember, its through regular permissions) yeah well, all of *your* files well, you can view files outside of the home folder from your regular account Basically, open up nautilus, everything you can browse to from there, you'll be able to browse through with sftp.

74449	what did you try so far?	I ran into that problem and my research showed me that when it does that, it's because the Compiz plugin isn't compatible at all with the hardware of your system so it automatically disables it so you don't have to worry about any serious software damage. weird, i remember using snow a year ago during christmas time lol, i wonder why it's not working now Not sure. Sometimes it's non-compatible hardware due to a driver upgrade. I know that happened. I'm currently trying to figure out why my audio is just fine and perfectly loud on my Windows partition, but when I switch over to my Ubuntu side, the audio degrades heavily, even with the volumn all the way up. degrades meaning becomes distorted or just quiet? It's quiet as all get out. On Vista, I with the volumn turned all the way up, I can hear everything just fine in the next room. Switching over to my Ubuntu side, the volumns all the way up and I can't hear hardly anything. The room has to be so quiet you can hear a pin drop on the carpet before I hear anything.

Yeah, they updated, and yeah there aren't any debs for the latest version If there was a thumbnail tool that was optimised to create multiple version using one in memory version of the image, one file load, and then save out all requested versions, that would be good if you want to change aspect of produce thumbnail, you can make as many as 3 resizes, unless you use newer syntax, which there are no debs, and I loath the fact that it took them so long to even recognize this as a feature I am thinking to just write my own, but come on. Load image, resize it using a simple thumbnail syntax... I'll check google code and sf.net 	CHAT

213132	so, a rough guideline would be to check when the hardware that's in your machine first came out - if it was a at least year old when the last LTS came out, you're good with LTS. less than that, you might have to check.	32bit hmm, which other choices are there, other than going for LTS or the latest? well, I was deciding on 10 or 9 instead of 11, but now I'm dl'ing 11 alt as reisio had said.  We were having problems seeing the GUI for installation purposes.  We were booting to a usb flash drive and going right to busy box.  So I was just curious if overall my old dell had hardware issues with ubuntu. in general, there's two guidelines, i'd say: if it's a 'business'-kind of machine (rarely doing crazy stuff, basic work) and you do not need the latest software, LTS is an excellent choice but if your hardware is more recent, you might want to get the latest version, as it comes with a newer kernel (and with that, better support for newer hardware) 	CHAT

58404	never done it that way, not sure, but you might be able to do it with hardware, some systems have raid management built in, you'd have to look at the docs for your system	LVM is used in raid sitiuations, LVM is not necessarry unless you have setup a raid stack... just a ext4, or let the installer do it automatically do you suggest I choose the Guided - use entire disk, option? that would be reccommended so there are 2 drives in your system, and depending on what you need in terms of size, 120g enough for you? or do you need the full 240g of both drives, you could manually do it and put the webserver '/var/www' on the second drive or just stick with the first and add the other one later, or setup raid1 so it sees both drives as one partition depending on the bios of your system you can do it with hardware ... see the following trigger 	CHAT

Even my Atari MegaSTE using XBoot remembers the last used configuration by default, instead of booting on the first one. I'm just surprised that it was not available.

The problem I'm having as a programmer is, you're not seeing any useful error messages for me to form an accurate diagnosis. So I can't really understand why the install is failing. i would, but it's localised so it wouldn't help you it's the part where the installer wants to install packages from the cdrom so the base install is done, and it's setting up the system at this point i'm guessing it tries to get packages from the cdrom but it can't (it should use the usb device) 	CHAT

I installed Ubuntu 8.10 without a swap partition and I haven't created a file to use as swap space. But after 12 minutes, my computer is put to sleep automatically. This is impressive and unexpected. What gives? How does this work? Well, it is not actually put to sleep, more like it hibernates, because everything is turned off, the monitor, drives, fans, all but a blinking LED. swap is the partition that the system uses if you don't have enough memory, and is also used to store unused data to conserve memory I know about that, I'm not new to this.

72653	i first started on saybyon and I hated linux, cuz i thought that was linux when i first tried it.  you might go distro hopping till you find the one you like.  but nowadays it's ubuntu / arch / fedora / gentoo as the main contenders, then you go from there to what window manager and desktop environment you want to use...might take a while to find what your looking for	Out of all the distros out there, I believe Ubuntu has to be one of the highest on the install list over other distros.  Unless you want to compile your own kernel :p for the slowness on windows try 'advanced system care'...should repair registry; defrag hdd; delete other tmp files; etc. making it faster. but i would recommend using a lighter version of ubuntu like lubuntu etc yes, i believe that's why they made the version, leaning more towards older machines prepair for a smile on your face 	CHAT

Bossmanbeta-> just an idea, something like you forward an X with allowance for any host to connect to the forwarded port, and you can connect in one, from another, log off of one, ..i think its the gateway option on ssh..but i have not tried it myself Bossmanbeta-> i was thinking in terms of those warnings they say about X that can be monitored (so it  is unsecure), therefore I assume several host can listen in on the X broadcast.. appyJack-> we use it,, but no necessarily masters..

Or you could just look at the logs and try to find it anyways, it shouldn't be too hard  can i sent you the file? it should be in dmesg (you can just run 'dmesg' in the terminal to see it.)

70494	?  I don't think you can play 3d games with the os drivers.  I could be wrong, but as far as  I know you want to use the fglrx drivers.  What you might want to do is enter it without the special 3d desktop stuff on which.  You'll still be using the fglrlx drivers but your desktop won't be using the 3d card.  That'd be my guess because when I play Quake III with XGL Beryl stuff on it chokes hard	Hey, does the open source ATI driver have 3d acceleration? no or... I think it might have some but it is minimal so you need to use the binary driver for most 3d things. well... anyway you can 'swap drivers' in an easy way? Cause I'm running XGL/Beryl and want to play 3d games aswell... but I'm having some instability issues. Heard the fglrx drivers may be the cause and that open source drivers would be more stable. or... with the open source drivers I could install AIGLX, which is supposed to be more stable than XGL 	CHAT

'No' or 'Yes' would have been more straightforward, but 'usually' is even stranger :) that was kind of my issue. it's hard to use google-foo on a usually It sounds like Ubuntu's concept of vfat is different from Vista's. If you are actually writing the files and they (usually) persist across Ubuntu sessions, but don't show up in Vista, it may be that somehow Vista is mounting it as a different type of vfat than Ubuntu. c.f. the various vfat 'sizes' and options thanks.

238286	If they provide a .deb, it's better if you download that. If they only have .tar.gz you might need to compile it on your own, or they have their ways of installing. Usually instruction for installation is included in the tar.gz	The application over there should be in the repository. What application is it that you wish to install? The fastest and easiest way is through the command line in the terminal. However, if you are not familiar with that, you can just search for the name of the application in Ubuntu Software Center. It's should be the last entry in the menu when you click on Applications. Only Qcad and Varkon seem to be in the official repo and you can install that through sudo apt-get install qcad varkon Other software you need to get it from their respective website, it seems. Unfortunately, apart from QCad and Varkon, you can't get the others from Synaptic - unless they provide a repository which you can add to your list. 	CHAT

197996	you might want to use systemd or tmpwatch for that. dunno though. cronjob and find does the job well, too. And you can use -ls to 'debug' you find commands.	but find goes recursively into subdirectory. hence the need for a depth. so it will find all files in ./destination/ . And since you're trying to move the files there, it tells you, that they are already there. my goal here is to utilize this script in a delete fashion. I want to delete all avi's older than 5 days from a specific directory. I guessin that case I wouldn'tneed a depth, eh? I'm just using the .txt files as an example to test yes. 	CHAT

152437	can you point to any resources on downgrading to Edgy off the top of  your head? or does it need to be a clean reinstall	it seemed that the Kano script worked for quite a few people, though I'm not sure what Ubuntu version they used it could be that the version of the x server in ubuntu 7.10 is too new for that driver, so if you wanted to use fglrx 8.28, you'd also have to downgrade the x.org version, and then that would require other things to be downgraded, in a really ugly mess of dependencies actually the specific error that fglrxinfo gives is this Xlib:  extension 'XFree86-DRI' missing on display ':0.0'. yeah, but that might be a symptom rather thatn a root cause... i.e., the error is no direct rendering... bu there is no direct rendering because it is an imcompatible verison of X, or something 	CHAT

228140	well, you can mention it --we won't hold it against you.  But if it's too out of date, you might think about a clean install.	Is Ubuntu 10.4 better than 10.10? Different opinions. I am conservative and don't want to spend time fixing things, so I use 10.04.  My own suggestion is: 10.04 unless you know you need something that's not in 10.04, and then upgrade. The version *after* a LTS version tends to be more experimental than usual. I don't think you'll see us fighting over it.  We'll all say it depends on what you need. I use Kubuntu, which ... I guess a polite way of putting it is that it does not suck as much as it used to, so I'm sticking with the LTS version to make sure nothing's broken. Again different opinions. There's a matter of 'how is KDE' theoretically, and practically.  At this point, if you could go either way, you'll probably have a better experience with (GNOME) Ubuntu. 	CHAT

154878	run 'du -s /var'  (du = Disk Usage) on your current system to see how big the /var tree is.  If you think /var/www will grow to make /var double what it is already, then it makes sense for /var/www to be a separate filesystem.  The risk is that the smaller your partitions, the sooner they'll run out of space and you might end up w/ lots of unused space on the wrong partitions.	you've put a lot of thought into this.  do you do something computer-related for work? for a small home system, /, /home, /var makes sense.  If you need to decrease the size of your filesystems further, /usr and /var/www are good places to separate things, as are places under /var like /var/spool , /var/news (if you carry usenet), etc.  Ubuntu defaults to one big partition because that's what newbies from windows understand. yes, I work as a sysadmin it's a question of balance.  If /var/www is gonna be huge, then it makes sense to split it out.  /var is meant for files that get changed often.  For people who like to mount / read-only, /var is a good splitting point.  It's all described in teh filesystem standard (google FSSTND). somebody told me the filesystem standard was a good way to start undestanding linux.  i'm more for playing around and knowing just enough to get by than understanding.  that and it was a big .pdf if i remember correctly 	CHAT

No, there's no authentication going on.  The root account is locked, so it just logs you in to single user mode without it. You can't upgrade straight from breezy to gutsy.  No, you'll have to do it one at a time, however.... I have no X on it. 	CHAT

150039	yes - but you'd have to switch to that resolution prior to starting the game each time (so you might as well just use nvidia-settings gui)  -- if this was a 'normal' game with a resolution that could be selected, then there is a way to use xorg to automajically turn off one monitor when a game calls that resolution -- but if the game relies on what xorg's resolution is -> you gotta use nvidia-settings...  sorry to break bad news.	can you get into the game and set a resolution?  can you temporarily turn off one monitor with nvidia-settings and get into the game?  you need to know what resolution WoW wants before we can configure your xorg to match the settings. or turn turn this Windows mode on! Sorry, I thought I mentioned it: the game is not requesting resolutions. It asks the OS what resolutions are available. Unbuntu is returning that only the resolution 3360x1050 is available (which is way too wide). That's the resolution of both my monitors. I need to find a way to provide 1680x1050 as a resolution to the game, seeing as it's the one requesting from the OS what resolutions are available. then you have no choice but to use nvidia-settings, disable one monitor then start the game! are you sure there's no way to modify xorg.conf to reflect a different resolution?

36314	I'm kind of suspecting a network driver, for testing purposes, can you disable the wirless in the bios?	ahh alrighty. Is it always at approximately the same satge in each attempt? it's usually after these two lines: 'configuring network security' and 'configuring network'.  But twice it went some 3-4 steps further.  I tried maybe 4 times, sometimes with a network cable connected, sometimes not. does this system have wired AND wireless networking? I'm wondering if a driver module is hanging the boot process. I removed the 'quiet' and 'splash' options to try to find out what's going on, but this is all I could see.  Is there anything else I can try?  It takes extremely long to reboot, try, fail, reboot to windows again, come to chat, so the more ideas you could suggest to try at the same time the better :) yes, it has both.

Ah, I understand now.  You are expecting grep to return just the matching part of the expression, but in fact, it returns the entire line an easy solution to this problem is to use sed on the result of your grep roughly like  this    grep RE myfile | sed 's/^\(.*\)\(RE\)\(.*\)$/\2/'     where RE is the regular expression you are looking for in fact, you can probably do something like this to avoid typing it twice:  bash#  RE='my regular expression'; grep '$RE' myfile | sed 's/^\(.*\)\($RE\)\(.*\)$/\2/' 	CHAT

I would report it, but it wouldn't make much sense before I know a little more about where the bug is.
