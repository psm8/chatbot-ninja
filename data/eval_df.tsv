6376	i got a jeep 1996 grand cherokee limited 4x4 4.0 6cyl will this filter work for me	ATP Transmission filters are designed to keep the transmission fluid clean and flowing consistently, as intended by the original manufacturer. This is achieved by matching the OE specification of particle filtration and fluid flow. Every transmission will eventually accumulate debris from normal wear and tear. It is critical that the transmission fluid is kept clean so that the valve body and other vital components do not become clogged making them in-operable. By regularly replacing your transmission filter, you will be extending your transmissions life and avoiding the possibility of costly repairs. <br> The exclusive 3rd Hand Pan Gasket is an innovative gasket solution invented by ATP. It features slightly undersized bolt holes that hold pan bolts in place during installation, which can be identified by small tabs on the outer perimeter. The 3rd Hand retaining feature makes a cumbersome installation process much easier. <br> The material composition of the gasket is also unique. The fibrous gasket swells slightly with the first heat cycle, preventing any leaks long term and filling in imperfections on the pan and transmission surfaces. The feature also ensures transmission pan bolts do not loosen over time due to the expanded gasket. <br> About ATP Automotive: ATP was founded on July 1, 1955. The company was an innovator of transmission rebuild kits and, over the years, has expanded its product offering to include automatic transmission filter kits, repair kits, cables, flywheels and ring gears, cabin air filters and chemicals. In 2001, the Graywerks by ATP line was introduced. This line consists of exhaust manifolds, harmonic balancers, timing covers and engine and transmission pans. ATP Automotive strives to provide the highest quality parts to their valued customers. The company was fully rebranded as ATP Automotive in 2014.', 'With over 60 years of experience in transmission service, you can trust ATP Automotive to deliver the quality and performance your vehicle demands.	ask_question

11704	Will these work as replacement speakers for my Monsoon Stereo in my 2004 Pontiac Grand AM?	Music will sound its best with ACDelco GM Original Equipment Car Speakers, and are GM-recommended replacements for your vehicles original components. Speakers turn electrical energy into mechanical energy to move air, using a permanent magnet and an electromagnet. The electromagnet is energized when the radio or amplifier (if equipped) delivers current to the voice coil on the speaker. The voice coil will form a north and south pole that will cause the voice coil and the speaker cone to move in relation to the permanent magnet. The current delivered to the car speaker is rapidly changing alternating current (A/C). This causes the speaker cone to move in two directions, producing sound. These original equipment car speakers have been manufactured to fit your GM vehicle, providing the same performance, durability, and service life you expect from General Motors.	ask_question

When waxing the vehicle, some wax may build up along the film edges. This can easily be removed when dry with a soft cloth, such as a 3M Microfiber Detail Cloth (39016). Do not use any waxes containing dyes or waxes that are not recommended for urethanes. Abrasive polishes and/or rubbing compounds are not to be used. </br></br> What products does 3M recommend to best maintain 3M Paint Protection Film? </br> 3M makes a variety of products to help maintain the beauty of your vehicle. 3M Car Wash Soap (3M Part #39000), 3M Show Car Paste Wax (3M Part #39526) and 3M Liquid Wax (3M Part #39026).

If the film has been present a long time, or if the film and vehicle are cold, a heat gun or hair dryer may be used to soften the adhesive, allowing easier removal. If any adhesive remains on the vehicle after removal of the film, it can be removed by using 3M Adhesive Remover (3M Part #03618), according to the package directions. </br></br> If 3M Paint Protection Film is removed from the vehicle, can it be re-used? </br> Once the film has been applied and set, the adhesive will not stick a second time. </br></br> After 3M Paint Protection Film has been removed, how do I get any excess adhesive off my vehicle? </br> If any adhesive remains on the vehicle after removal of the film, it can be removed by using 3M Adhesive Remover (3M Part #03618), according to the package directions.	ask_question

39489	I was wondering if this hitch is compatible with the 2014 Dodge Durango?	"The CURT class 3 trailer hitch is the most common type of trailer hitch installed on full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. It is also found on full-size cars, crossover SUVs, minivans and mid-size trucks. That is because the class 3 packs the punch of a heavyweight hitch while still staying light on its feet. This CURT class 3 hitch offers a gross trailer weight capacity of 5,000 lbs. and a comparable tongue weight capacity of 500 lbs. It is designed to be a custom-fit trailer hitch for certain years of the Jeep Grand Cherokee or Dodge Durango (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see the CURT application guide at curtmfg.com).The 2"" x 2"" receiver tube opening of this class 3 hitch is able to accept a hitch-mounted accessory, such as a bike rack or cargo carrier, or a ball mount to tow most standard size trailers, including utility trailers, single-horse livestock trailers, boat trailers and large campers. One special feature about the class 3 that is not found in classes 1 or 2 is its compatibility with a weight distribution hitch. When used in combination with a WD hitch, this class 3\'s gross trailer weight capacity increases to 7,500 lbs. and the tongue weight capacity to 750 lbs. (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest weight capacity of any towing component).CURT class 3 trailer hitches are engineered to be strong and capable, having a quality steel frame and a solid finish. They are put through strenuous testing before being deemed ready for market and come with two coatings -- a liquid Bonderite coating and a powder coat in high-gloss black -- that cure together to form a strong resistance against rust, scratching, UV damage and other wear. Our hitches are our pride, and as such, we back them up with a limited lifetime warranty and a one-year finish warranty.', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/c75d3399-2760-41dd-a86d-df0b20a08e9f._SL220__.jpg"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f42eb670-c2dc-4de0-bf09-890bb61a6e0c._SL220__.jpg"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/f247b526-0fe0-4482-8386-eb4d2f1430f6._SL220__.jpg"">', '<img alt="""" src=""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/vc/c84e3c81-4344-424f-8996-71eae6d524a0._SL220__.jpg"">', 'Whatever your lifestyle, choosing the right CURT trailer hitch for your vehicle is easy.

B&M's Precision Sport Shifter offers a dramatic improvement in shifting performance, due in large part to the reduction in the stick's travel (or 'throw'). Using their decades of experience, superior designs, and extremely durable components, B&M re-engineered the stick and its pivot point for better leverage and to reduce the distance that the knob end must travel to engage the gears. The result is a short throw shifter that should provide smooth, precise shifts for hundreds of thousands of miles, with less driver fatigue and a more professional feel. The shifter is CAD-designed and engineered as a direct bolt-in replacement, so it can be installed easily in about an hour, and function properly with the factory boot, insulation, and console surround.

5250	I have a Honda Civic Sedan EX. If I get these for the front, what would you recommend for the rear?	Posi Quiet brake pads are manufactured using the same positive molding process utilized by Original Equipment suppliers. Positive molding uses extreme pressure to compress the friction material and bond it to the backing plate. This process assures consistent friction material density throughout the pad, resulting in even wear and performance characteristics throughout the life of the brake pad. The number one reasons for dissatisfaction with brake pads are noise and vibration. Centric Parts has recognized these issues and is constantly improving its products to eliminate these issues. Posi Quiet brake friction features either precision cut or shaved backing plates and mechanically attached shims; these small details ensure proper fitment in the caliper and virtually eliminate noise associated with pad vibration. In addition to these features Centric Parts has added a scorching process to all of its Posi Quiet brake pads. This additional process forces any impurities out of the friction material and pre-burnishes the pads to greatly accelerate the break-in process.	ask_question

10350	Did you have to have your stock studs pressed out, and the new studs they give you pressed in?	Honda drum brakes work fine as long as they are properly maintained and do not develop leaks of mud and water.

The Highlifter front disc brake is designed to replace the mud susceptible, front drum brakes on Honda utility ATVs with a high performance disc brake. Once installed, the disc brake allows easy cleaning of mud and debris from hubs without disassembly, and water has no place to collect and corrode components.

11022	I'm thinking of wrapping one of these around my hydraulic tank on my dump trailer. Thoughts this should work right	A battery can lose 60% of its starting power when the temperature reaches 0-degrees F. Cold engines require more power from the battery at these temperatures. These two factors make it imperative that you use a battery wrap to extend the life of your battery, and assist in your cold weather starting requirements. Fully charged batteries have a significant drop in power at colder temperatures. The battery wrap allows you to have full cranking power regardless of the cold. The battery heater should not be used when the temperature is above freezing.	ask_question
7245	What are the connector on this cooler?	Adding this B&amp;M SuperCooler keeps the ATF and transmission cooler, and keeping a vehicle's transmission cool is essential for dependability, especially in performance applications. The unit is designed to be very efficient for its size and weight, to cool much better than an ordinary 'fin and tube' cooler, and to reduce the risk of lube system failure. Using fluxless, oven brazed construction for vibration resistance, it is built out of lightweight aluminum alloy and features a revolutionary 'stacked plate' design with multiple oil flow paths. The unit monitors resistance to flow by allowing a controlled amount of ATF to pass through a self-regulating orifice. Controlled by viscosity, thicker ATF is returned directly to lube through two bypass openings in the stacked plate core, while thinner ATF is directed through the core to cool as operating temperatures increase.	ask_question

These premium spark plugs also feature an iridium-enhanced center electrode and nickel-plated shell. Guaranteed for 7 years.', '', '', '', '', 'Autolite highly recommends that you consult with your vehicles owners manual for any specific instructions for changing the spark plugs. Engines can vary widely by make and model. These instructions should be considered for general guidance only.', 'Replacing spark plugs can be a simple job, if you take things one step at a time. Given a basic understanding of mechanical matters, here&#039;s a guide to the proper procedures in changing spark plugs.', '1. Carefully remove the spark plug wires. Grasp the plug wire boot, twist about one-quarter turn to break the seal, then lift straight off. Use plug boot pullers if the boot doesn&#039;t break free easily. Number plug wires with tape as you remove them to avoid crossing them. (illus. 1)', '2. Loosen each spark plug so it can be removed. Clean the seat area with a blast of compressed air, or by blowing through a soda straw. This prevents dirt from falling into the combustion chamber when the old plugs are removed. (illus. 2)', '3. Remove the plugs and line them up in cylinder order. Inspection of the firing ends of the plugs can identify a number of engine problems that may need correction. (illus. 3)', '4. Gap new plugs as recommended in your owner&#039;s manual or a Spark Plug Catalog. Use a feeler gauge to measure the gap between the center and ground electrode. The gauge should pass through snugly but easily. If it&#039;s too loose or too tight, reset the gap.', '5. Screw new plugs in by hand until tight. If the plug starts to go in hard, use a thread chaser to clean the threads. Use a torque wrench to tighten the spark plugs following the manufacturer&#039;s recommendations, or refer to a torque chart in the Spark Plug Catalog. If you don&#039;t have a torque wrench, see the bottom of the torque chart for hand tightening recommendations.', '6. Replace spark plug wires in the correct order. Check to see if the boots are brittle or cracked, and if there is corrosion on the connector inside the boot. If any of these conditions are present, the spark plug wire should be replaced.', '7. Start the engine. If it misfires or idles roughly, the wires are crossed or not connected to the plugs correctly. Check the firing order and connections closely.	ask_question

Meguiars ScratchX 2.0 is easy to use by hand, but may also be used with Meguiars DA Power System or with Meguiars Dual Action Polisher.', 'Before applying Meguiar\'s ScratchX 2.0 to the vehicle, begin by washing and drying the car thoroughly, as it will allow evalutating the surface of the vehicle for the presence of various defects needing correction.Defects fall into two basic categories: above surface bonded contaminants (industrial fall out, paint overspray, tree sap mist, and bird droppings) and below surface defects (fine scratches, swirl marks, etching, and oxidation). Above surface bonded contaminants often cannot be seen but they can be felt. Run a clean hand over the paint of the vehicle immediately after washing and drying it. Does the paint feel ""as smooth as glass""? If the paint surface is rough to the touch, this is an indication to clay the car using Meguiars Smooth Surface Clay Kit first. Below surface defects generally cannot be felt, but they can be seen, especially in strong, direct light.', ""Good lighting is critical to evaluating the surface of the paint, because most cars will look good in the shade; therefore inspect the car's finish in direct sunlight or under strong fluorescent lights. Cobweb or spider web swirls come primarily from the washing and drying process when poor technique or tools are used; for example, the use of old towels, dishwashing detergents, and coarse sponges. Holograms however, are a specific type of defect caused by the improper use of a high speed rotary buffer. These types of defects not only mar the finish but reduce the paints ability to reflect light clearly and cleanly, making the paint appear dull, faded and washed out. Removing below surface defects like light scratches, swirls, oxidation and bird dropping etching restores the clarity and reflectivity of the paint, making colors more vibrant and reflections more brilliant."", ""Liquid paint cleaners should be applied to small areas at a time, no larger than one square foot when working by hand or two square feet when working with a dual action polisher such as the Meguiar's DA Power System or Meguiar's Dual Action Polisher. Working small areas at a time is crucial in order to concentrate the work rather than spreading it out over a too large of an area. Keep the following points in mind when working with any paint cleaner like Meguiar's ScratchX: Paint cleaners do not need to dry before removing and in fact should be wiped off immediately after they're worked over the finish. Paint cleaners need to be worked into the finish; they are not wipe on, wipe off products. Deep defects (scratches) that go through the clear coat cannot be corrected without repainting or applying touch up paint. The harder the paint and the deeper the defect, the smaller the area to work at one time. Paint cleaners remove everything off the surface of the paint including wax, so after using paint cleaner re-apply a protective coating of wax."", 'By Hand:', 'By Dual Action Polisher or DA Power System:', 'Meguiars is one of the worldwide leaders in car care.

The coating may also be used to protect wheel wells, quarter panels, interior sides of fenders, the underside of the hood, the bottom sides of floor pans and more. The rubberized undercoating also helps deaden noise, allowing for a more pleasant and quieter ride.

Protecting your vehicle with an application of rubberized undercoating is advised for long-term protection of the undercarriage.

5247	Will they fit for my 2004 Honda Civic Hybrid?	Posi Quiet brake pads are manufactured using the same positive molding process utilized by Original Equipment suppliers. Positive molding uses extreme pressure to compress the friction material and bond it to the backing plate. This process assures consistent friction material density throughout the pad, resulting in even wear and performance characteristics throughout the life of the brake pad. The number one reasons for dissatisfaction with brake pads are noise and vibration. Centric Parts has recognized these issues and is constantly improving its products to eliminate these issues. Posi Quiet brake friction features either precision cut or shaved backing plates and mechanically attached shims; these small details ensure proper fitment in the caliper and virtually eliminate noise associated with pad vibration. In addition to these features Centric Parts has added a scorching process to all of its Posi Quiet brake pads. This additional process forces any impurities out of the friction material and pre-burnishes the pads to greatly accelerate the break-in process.	ask_question

4485	Older P/U with a glass-mount mirror a few inches below the w/s trim. How/where do you run/conceal the wires from the mirror to the power source?	CIPA's line of Day/Night mirrors are the perfect replacement for your factory installed mirror. This 10 inch mirror attaches to the windshield on a swivel mount, and can be tilted to reduce the brightness and glare of headlights shining directly at eye level. The front and rear internal faces of the Day/Night mirror glass are not parallel to one another, allowing a manual tab adjustment to switch between day and night positions. In the day position, the front face is slanted and the reflective back-side provides a strong reflection. When in the night position, its reflective rear face is slanted out of line of the drivers sight. Since the non-reflective front allows the majority of the light to pass through, only a tiny amount of light is reflected into the drivers eyes. This means an increase in both safety and comfort at a fraction of dealer costs. This mirror features map lights with downward illumination to allow passengers to read without interfering with driver visibility. Lights are controlled individually. Day/Night mirrors are also available without map lights in various sizes. Fits OEM mounting on all cars, trucks and vans. Mirror mounting adhesive not included. Bracket is included.

22543	has anyone tried to program the homelink ?	"This revolutionary product lets you control your bi mode exhaust system on demand via a tiny wireless remote or the Homelink feature in your car . One of the coolest technologies is the ""bi-mode"" exhaust. Whisper quite up until 3500 RPM and then a wide open race car sound as the flaps located in the tips open. The problem is the inability to control this feature. Up until now, the owner\'s only choice was to pull the fuse or to install wiring, drill a hole for a switch to turn the quiet mode off. After spending $75,000, the last thing I would want to do is start running wires and drilling holes. The only wireless remote designed to give you full control over the exhaust. This patent pending product requires no drilling or running wires through your car. It\'s a simple 5 min simple plug and play installation that anyone can do. Once installed, you will have full control over the exhaust mode, via a simple ON/OFF remote wireless controller or your Homelink transmitter (simple programming required, instructions provided). Once the Homelink is programmed, you can just use that to work your exhaust. Actually, you will get two sleek ON/OFF wireless controls that can be mounted anywhere and will control the exhaust up to 50\' away. The OFF mode gives you that race car sound 100% of the time. The ON mode works as the stock setting and is quiet to preset OEM 3,500 RPM. You will receive the professionally engineered plug and play wireless receiver, two miniature remotes and instructions.

18802	will it fit a 2006 mazda 3	Replacing an old, leaky or missing gas cap will save as much as a gallon of gas every 15 days and can pay for itself in less than three months. Stant gas caps are OE style and meet or exceed all original equipment performance and safety standards. A gas/fuel cap performs three very important functions; safety of the vehicle's occupants, fuel economy and reduce emissions. Safety: Without a fuel cap, gasoline vapors will be present around your car at all times. Those vapors can be ignited by a random spark or flame and are very dangerous if you are involved in an accident or rollover. Fuel Economy: According to Sun Oil Company research, a vehicle with a missing or inoperative fuel cap will allow 176 pounds (22 gallons) of gasoline to evaporate over the period of one year. Emissions: Gasoline vapors emit hydrocarbons which dissolve the earth's ozone layer and cause smog.	ask_question

"A CURT custom wiring harness (also called a T-connector) is a simple, plug-and-play electrical device that eliminates the need for cutting, splicing and soldering when installing vehicle-to-trailer wiring.Most vehicles do not come ready to tow. Unless your vehicle has a towing package, it is probably not equipped with a trailer wiring connector. This is where CURT's custom wiring harnesses come into play. Custom wiring harnesses plug into your vehicle's electrical system using original equipment (OEM) connectors. Our custom wiring harnesses use two or more OEM connectors to plug in at the taillight assembly and provide a standard trailer socket to allow a trailer to be plugged into your vehicle's power system.This harness provides a 4-way flat connector socket and comes with a circuit-protected converter. It is designed to be a custom wiring harness for certain years of the Dodge Caliber (except SRT), Dodge Durango, Dodge Grand Caravan with Stow-n-Go, Chrysler Town and Country van with Stow-n-Go or Jeep Patriot (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see the CURT application guide at curtmfg.com).

The unit will automatically determine which system to use and switch to it. The ScanGaugeII works on all 1996 or newer OBDII cars, including gas, diesel, propane and hybrid vehicles, as well as vehicles with the latest CAN systems.

At the same time, keep an eye on coolant temperature, engine speed, and much more in real time. If there is a young driver in the house or friends borrow your car, the ScanGaugeII can record speeds of up to 158 mph and store the information for you to view later, so you will know just how fast your young driver or friend was going last night.

It comes with a dual-pivoting head, 10 degrees of lateral movement and an anti-rattle skid plate to provide a smoother, quieter ride. The E16 also comes with easy, single-handle operation and a durable carbide powder coat for long-lasting protection against the elements. With four height adjustment settings, the E16 is quick and simple to install, and it is backed by a five-year limited warranty.This 16K 5th wheel hitch head comes attached to the CURT R16 roller.

10735	Does it work on r404?	The INFICON TEK-Mate Refrigerant Leak Detector incorporates an electrochemical sensor consisting of a ceramic substrate, doped with a reactive element, and maintained at high temperature by a built-in heating element. When a halogen-bearing gas contacts with the hot surface, the chlorine, fluorine, or bromine atoms are separated from the molecule and ionized. This causes an electrical current to flow within the ceramic to a collection electrode at the center. Careful selection and application of the ceramic permits the INFICON sensor to provide similar responses to CFCs (such as R11 and R12), HCFCs (such as R22 and R123), HFCs (such as R134a) as well as replacement blends (such as R404A and R410A) so that the operator need not determine the refrigerant in use, nor remember to set a selector switch. Furthermore, when searching for HFCs, the instrument does not have an exaggerated response to traces of chlorine bearing vapors which are frequently present. Made in the USA.	ask_question

Its also a very popular choice for dealerships that have been modifying vehicles for customers who want all the work performed by a dealer which speaks volumes to its quality and engineering. \n\nOur budget lift kit uses the poly coil spacers for the rear so the spring rate and ride quality is not changed in back. The front uses our exclusive strut spacers. These spacers do not go inside the struts, all lift is obtained outside the strut assembly. We\'ve heard of other shops using thin steel, but if you punish your Liberty the way we do, you\'ll be happy for the overkill engineering behind our strut spacers. The strut spacer itself is built from two plates and a spacer setup. The bottom plate measures 3/8"" thick and is double welded (top and bottom) to a 1/4"" thick DOM spacer tube. The upper plate is 1/2"" thick material! We guarantee our strut spacer for life. It cannot and will not ever fail! The strut spacer kit provides a 2.5"" lift for the front end and does not change the ride quality or handling of the vehicle. The struts are as exactly the same as factory spec since the front coils are not compressed inside the strut assembly. You maintain full compression and extension of the front strut system, a great ride, and lift to clear nice-looking larger tires. Forget those silly mini-van tires they stick on our Jeeps from the dealership, this is the way a Jeep ought to look! The budget lift system comes with all hardware and mounting studs included. A great kit for the Do-it-yourselfer as no strut compression machines are needed. Jeep dealerships are already contacting us about this system and recognize it as perhaps THE kit in the industry for Liberty. We love it, and so will you!"	ask_question

21130	Does this switch assy come with the panel?	The driver's window is most likely to stop functioning, since it gets the most use. If the driver's window fails, most likely the window master switch is the culprit. The next most likely cause is the window motor. There is almost never another reason, although the window could become stuck due to derailment. This could happen if someone or something weighted down the window with an elbow, etc., as it was being raised. The window motor may fail all at once, but it usually works intermittently before failing completely. (This is a classic symptom in Toyotas!) The window will stop in one place and then move a little more after waiting a few minutes. The motor is most likely to fail when putting the window up, due to the much greater load placed on the motor when moving the weight of the window against gravity. If the window worked intermittently going up and then failed, it could be the motor or the master switch. It is advisable in these cases to fully diagnose the problem before buying a part, if the expense of doing so is not greater than say $40 or the cost of the master switch, whichever is less	ask_question

4498	what plug fits a 2014 goldwing gl1800?	"The exceptional performance of the E3 spark plug starts with the unique open architecture of the E3 electrode. The design forces air gap discharges, creates the preferred edge-to-edge spark path, allows free replenishment of the spark zone with a fresh fuel/air charge, and exposes the flame front more directly to the piston head than other plug designs.Sparks naturally follow edge-paths as they leave an object. The E3 design presents multiple sharp edges to the center electrode.  Sparks flow between these edges at lower voltages, facilitating easier discharge than standard designs.  By forcing air sparks, the resistance to fouling is greatly increased in the E3 spark plug.  This lowers the self-cleaning temperature of the spark plug, allowing colder heat ranges to be used if desired.E3's distinctive spark plug design has proven, in testing in a range of engines, to simultaneously increase engine power output, reduce gasoline consumption, decrease hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions from the engine and materially extend the life of the spark plug."", '<table border=""0""><tbody> <tr> <td height=""522"">E3 Automotive spark plugs are a clear breakthrough in spark plug technology. Developed by researchers from leading engineering universities, E3\'s patented electrode design allows for a better spark, and resulting more complete flame kernal and flame front extending off the electrode, producing better overall localized pressure inside your vehicle\'s cylinders.

What these motorists may not know is that their choice of spark plug could play a significant role in reducing the level of greenhouse gases that their vehicles give off, as well as increasing overall fuel economy and potential power output. This is where E3 Spark Plug\'s DiamondFire technology comes in.', ""<strong>DiamondFire Technology</strong><br /> For the last 100 years, the only real advance in consumer spark plug technology has been to develop ways to make them cheaper. E3 Spark Plug's DiamondFire technology changes all of that through an improved electrode design that provides for more efficient burning of your vehicle's air/fuel vapor, leading to more pressure in the cylinder. These improvements are measurable, confirmed and based on the following design elements found in existing performance spark plugs."", 'First, the DiamondFire electrode directs the flame kernel to the piston more directly, reducing the travel time from the spark zone to the end gases via the open section at the top of the electrode. Given the short time available to get combustion started, the faster you can get the flame to the piston, the better. Second, the physical features of the electrode project further forward into the combustion chamber. This brings the spark zone closer to areas of probable ""good"" air/fuel mixture and also creates beneficial ""micro-aerodynamics"" within the spark zone. The initial combustion wave leaves the spark area at supersonic speeds above Mach 1, and the elevated edge provides a kind of chimney effect so the next round of air/fuel mixture gets into the spark zone more easily. Finally, the E3 electrode design features forced edge-to-edge spark discharge, which is the best way to get a spark to leave a surface. This improves upon the phenomena that drove race car drivers to ""cut back"" ordinary electrode spark plugs in order to improve the spark discharge. The spark itself occurs only when an avalanche of electrons migrates from the two electrodes (anode to cathode). Sharp edges are better at initiating electron migrations, and these accelerated electrons collide with matter inside the spark zone to release additional electrons. This design ensures that the whole population of electrons works to create a plasma channel through which the spark current flows more easily, resulting in an increase in both power output and fuel economy, while reducing emissions in gasoline engines and the build up of carbon deposits on engine surfaces.', '<strong>Key Features</strong>:', '<strong>5-Year or 100,000 Mile Limited Warranty</strong><br /> E3 Automotive spark plugs used for personal, family or household purposes are warranted by the manufacturer to provide an experience of more power on less fuel, quicker starts and less fouling than competitive standard spark plugs, and to be free of defects in material or workmanship, for five years or 100,000 miles from the date of purchase. In the event of provable defect within the stated warranty period, the manufacturer will either replace the item(s), or refund the purchase price at their discretion.', '<strong>About Pyrotek E3</strong><br /> Headquartered in Point Vedra, Florida, Pyrotek E3, d.b.a. E3 Spark Plugs, was formed to help customers increase power, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce engine emissions that contribute to global warming. Their advanced DiamondFire electrode design burns fuel more efficiently and completely, increasing mileage, horsepower and drastically cutting toxic emissions.', '', 'The DiamondFIRE ground electrode configuration increases the amount of combustion pressure created during each power stroke of an engine, which results in a marked increase in power output, fuel economy, and reduced emissions in all gasoline engines.', 'Smoother Acceleration and Idle  The faster flame propagation initiated by the Patented DiamondFIRE ground electrode results in a more complete burn of the fuel/air mixture.', 'Energy  More pressure is created against the cylinder and more of the available fuel is put to work. Power is improved 3%-6% on average in typical operating ranges. Results may vary.', 'Efficiency  Another benefit of E3s faster flame propagation is less fuel is wasted, resulting in improved fuel efficiency. Lab and Dyno testing typically results in 3%-4% improved Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC). Results may vary.', 'Ecology  E3s more complete burn drastically reduces carbon emissions and carbon build up.', 'As the designated catalyst for the ignition of fuel in gasoline powered cars, trucks, motorcycles and small engines, spark plugs are a small, but constant factor in the workings of the vast majority of motorists on the road.

ODYSSEY Batteries Automotive and LTV Battery delivers the massive starting power, rapid recovery and amazing deep cycling capability that vehicle demand. Whether for everyday or emergency use, vehicles are loaded with more electronics than would have been imaginable just a few years ago. And hobbyist vehicles now include more specialties and specialized power demands than ever before. Fortunately, the ODYSSEY battery has been designed to keep up with the changes. Because its plates are made of pure virgin lead (unlike the lead alloy in most batteries), ODYSSEY packs more plates in. More plates mean more plate surface area, and much more power. Twice the overall power and three times the life of conventional batteries, up to 400 cycles at 80 percentage depth of discharge. These batteries are built for a range of performance from everyday vehicles, classic and antique cars, high performance cars, 4x4 and Off-Road, to modified vehicles. Its construction consists of pure virgin lead plates for maximum surface area and optimized recycling, AGM (absorbed glass mat) design that eliminates acid spills, high conductivity, corrosion-resistant tin-plated brass terminals, high integrity terminal seal, a sealed design resulting in gases recycled internally, a self-regulating relief valve, tough flame retardant cell containers and robust internal cell connections to prevent vibration damage. ODYSSEY batteries beat spiral-wound. Compared to spiral-wound batteries of equal size, ODYSSEY batteries pack 15 percentage more plate surface area into the case. Avoiding the dead space between cylinders in six-pack designs means ODYSSEY batteries deliver more power and 40 percentage more reserve capacity.	ask_question

Replace fluid according to Owner's Manual recommendations.<br />Calipers and wheel cylinders should be checked every brake inspection and serviced or replaced as required.<br />Inspect the brake lines for rust, punctures or visible leaks (you may be able to do this, but consult a qualified technician if necessary)<br />The following should be conducted by a qualified technician:<ul><li>Inspection of the brake hoses for brittleness or cracking</li><li>Inspection of brake lining and pads for wear or contamination by brake fluid or grease</li><li>Inspection of wheel bearings and grease seals</li><li>Parking brake adjustments (as needed)</li></ul>New DuraStop rotors DO NOT need machining.<br /><br /><strong>Used rotors can be machined provided minimum thickness can be maintained:</strong><br />Before you machine rotors, make sure the lathe is clean, within specs and has sharp tool bits.<br />After completing the finish cut, sand both sides of the rotor for one minute per side using a sanding block and 130- to 150-grit sandpaper to obtain a non-directional finish.<br />After sanding, wash the rotor with dish soap and water. DO NOT clean the rotor with brake cleaner/solvent-based product.<br />Thoroughly clean the calipers, caliper slide sand hardware. Remove all dirt, rust and grease.<br /><br />DuraStop brake tech tips:<br />Lubricate caliper slides, shims and rubber components.<br />Use ACDelco silicone-based lubricant or equivalent before installation. ACDelcolubricant is rated at 2,000F.<br /><br />DO NOT use a petroleum-based or spray adhesive product:<br />Lubricate all hardware rubber components and all metal-to-metal contact points.<br />Give caliper slides and disc pad shims/insulators a thin film of lubricant. This will allow the shim to withstand normal brake pad movement without damage to the shim. Additionally, this helps dampen vibration. Make sure the disc pads are tight in the caliper and torque the caliper to the housing. Check the adjustment of the rear brakes. Adjust if necessary. After cleaning all wheel-hub mating surfaces, install the wheels. Make sure they are torqued to manufacturer's specifications. <br /><br />D3EA tested and approved.	ask_question

44733	How do I deal with some small rust spots on my motorcycle in order to use the product to replate chrome parts?	Plug N' Plate is a new concept in plating small parts. Our unique mains power pack supplies just the right amount of power allowing you to brush, and in some situations, dip plate your smaller components. The Plug N' Plate system will also allow you to patch repair areas where the original plating has worn away. Plug N' Plate is ideal for vintage vehicle restorers, antique collectors and dealers, and small workshops doing prototype work. What could be simpler? The Plug N' Plate wand is attached to the red plug on the Power Pack, and the alligator clip is attached to the work-piece. The end of the wand is covered in an absorbent bandage, which is soaked in the plating solution for a few seconds. By simply stroking the part with swift brush strokes, the circuit is closed and the plating metal bearing solution goes to work, depositing its beautiful layer onto the object. Plug N' Plate may be applied onto most metals. To see which kit plates onto which metal, read our instruction booklet. To plate onto Stainless Steel, use the Plug N' Plate Copper system. When gold plating onto stainless, apply our Stainless Steel Activator For Gold with a stainless wand and 4.5V power pack, then you may gold plate directly onto the stainless part. We do not recommend plating aluminum directly with our Plug N' Plate kits. Use our Flash Copper Kit with zincate primer first, then you may Plug N' Plate onto the copper. To plate plastic, or other non-conductive parts, spray with Conductive Paint, dip in Tinning Solution, then tank plate with acid copper, then use a Plug N' Plate kit.	ask_question

10348	will this fit a 1991 Fourtrax 300 4x4?	Honda drum brakes work fine as long as they are properly maintained and do not develop leaks of mud and water. Once internal components are subjected to mud and water corrosion, the damage is difficult to reverse without repeated rebuilding. When allowed to remain in the brake drum, abrasive sand and muddy water damages all internal components including bearings, seals and brake components. The Highlifter front disc brake is designed to replace the mud susceptible, front drum brakes on Honda utility ATVs with a high performance disc brake. Once installed, the disc brake allows easy cleaning of mud and debris from hubs without disassembly, and water has no place to collect and corrode components. Applications include Honda 300 Fourtrax 4x4 (92-99) (requires 12 inch diameter wheels), Honda 350 Rancher 4x4 (00-06), Honda 400 Rancher (04-06), Honda 400 Foreman 4x4 (95-03) (requires 12 inch diameter wheels), Honda 450 Foreman 4x4 (98-04), Honda 500 Rubicon 4x4 (00-04) and Honda 650 Rincon 4x4 (03-05).	ask_question

27266	Do you need to use a lubricant? If so, what do you recommend?	"Griot\'s Garage#11153 Cleaner,Detailing Clay,8 fluid oz., Each. G05-11153  Description:Regardless of how clean you think your paint is, there are still contaminants stuck on the paint that you need to remove before waxing or polishing your paint. Paint Cleaning Clay leaves behind an ultra-smooth surface that will make your wax adhere better and last longer, too. It also makes the wax much easier to buff out, reducing your ""elbow grease"" substantially. Clay is safe for all paint and also works great on glass to get it squeaky clean. To use, just remove the clay from the wrapper, spray the paint\'s surface with Speed Shine (acts as a lubricating fluid), and rub the clay back and forth until there is no drag. This means your paint is clean! Unlike other cleaners and polishes, no buffing or hard circular motions are necessary. Takes literally one fourth the time as it would using paint cleaner! Follow up with Best of Show Wax and your paint will look stunning! The large 8 ounce (226 gram) bar cleans about 7 vehicles, depending on the amount of contamination your surface is covered with.Richard Grioturges you to try this clay. The results are amazing!', 'Regardless of how clean you think your paint is, contaminants are still stuck on the paint. Many enthusiasts don&#039;t realize polishing is for defect removal, Clay is for the removal of the roughness you can feel with your fingertips.

43440	Has any one had water up to the windshield with this, How did the snorkel do?	"Modular XHD Snorkel System from Rugged Ridge relocates the venerable stock air intake location to help reduce dust clogged filters and the risk of hydro-locking your engine. It is also the first snorkel designed with the modular functionality of a Pre-filter Low Mount and Ram High Mount air intake design. Unlike other snorkels, you don't have to give up flexibility for functionality. Not only did we engineer our snorkel to allow the windshield to fold and doors to be removed, we built it for use with our dual battery tray, windshield light bar and windshield light mounting tabs. The Modular XHD Snorkel System comes standard with the Pre-filter Low Mount. The Pre-filter Low Mount relocates the air intake to just below the windshield and draws cool air from outside the hot engine compartment. The optional Ram High Mount design allows the air intake to be extended up an additional 21 inch to the top of the windshield. The two air intake mounts are easily interchangeable to give you the modular functionality best suited to your needs. The system is manufactured from premium thermoformed plastic, mandrel bent aluminum and hi-temp silicone connection hoses. Built in manual drain valves channel away excess water to prevent it from entering the intake system. It installs with minor modification to the fender, but without the major cutting and surgery that other kits require. The new lower air cleaner box installs in place of the factory unit, so you don't have to hack and tap.

47642	Would this work on Kawasaki Z1000, 2007?	GIpro DS Series The all new GIpro-DS from HealTech Electronics is a unique Gear Position Indicator. It is designed for motorcycles equipped with Diagnostic System connector - including fuel injected motorcycles from Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Triumph, Buell, Harley and Ducati. While our original GIpro/ATRE is the #1 choice for riders looking for gear position indicator, the list of supported bike models is very limited. Due to high demand for our GIpro, we have developed the DS-Series, which is compatible with more motorcycles than the original GIpro. (Note: The GIpro/ATRE will not be discontinued as the DS-Series does not have ATRE feature). The GIpro-DS works on different principle than competitive products on the market. It reads the gear position information directly from the ECU, which makes it faster and more reliable than other gear indicators sold today. There are no buttons, no programming wires. The unit is fully automatic. There's no need to cut and splice wires, and no need to access several connectors. You need to connect ONE plug only under the seat - it can't get any easier than this. Another unique feature is the size. It is the smallest, most compact gear indicator available, while it has an extra bright, sunlight-viewable display. The perfect size. The unit will be available with Red, Blue, Green and Yellow display. It has a simple and clear front face which goes along nicely with the factory instrument cluster. The product is rugged, 100% weatherproof and comes with 2-years replacement warranty.	ask_question

30507	does this meet bmw ll01 requirements?	"It is specifically designed for powerful and recent cars fitted with high displacement engines, gasoline direct injection and turbo Diesel and catalytic converters. Numerous car maker approvals make this product a multi-purpose and is especially recommended when the car is under warranty. Suitable for leaded or unleaded gasoline, diesel fuels and LPG. The OPEL/GM diesel LL B-025 standard requires two main properties to the lubricant such as high HTHS and very low volatility to drastically decrease oil consumption. Motul 8100 X-cess 5W-40 is especially recommended for OPEL 2.0 and 2.2 DTI engines (extended drain interval by computer on board).

A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is.  Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or ""W"") performance.', ""This oil has a weight of SAE 5W-40, meaning it has an SAE viscosity rating of 5 in cold temperatures and a rating of 40 at normal operating temperature.

Sporting a sleek black profile appearance that is not altered up by the arched bow rods inserted into the material of other tonneau covers, it is a testament to the TruXedo brand name, and is designed to add a touch of style to most any pickup truck. <p/> In addition, the TruXedo TruXport offers the best in function, providing bed protection and improved gas mileage up to 10% by way of its well-conceived aerodynamic design. Initial installation can be completed with minimal tools by virtually any Do-it-yourselfer in as little as 20 minutes with no drilling or cutting, instead utilizing a clamp system around your truck\'s box rail. Once installed, the industrial strength cover relies on a combination of Velcro closures along the top rails that are among the widest in the industry, loop and hook fasteners at the tailgate and a manual tension control system that compensates for material expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes to keep it firmly in place. Reliably tight and secure, the TruXport protects the contents of your truck bed from all weather conditions within a temperature range of -20&deg;F to well into the triple digits. Additional features include availability for a wide range of pickup models and makes, the ability to open the tailgate while the cover is on and accommodation during installation of bed liners and bed caps. <p/> <b>Simple Care and Maintenance</b><br/> The TruXedo TruXport leather grain fabric cover can be hand washed with mild soap and water or cleaned in a car wash. Owners should ensure that they thoroughly rinse the cover to remove any soap residue. The cover can also be treated with any vinyl protectant made for any tonneau cover. TruXedo recommends Pro-Tex Soft Tonneau Protectant to clean, preserve and protect TruXedo brand tonneau covers. As a rule of thumb, never use silicon, petroleum, or citrus based products on your tonneau cover. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>An affordable solution for those looking for a cover in the price range of a snap-on model, but with the features of high-end models.</li> <li>Cover height above bed rails of approximately 1&frac12;"" adds aerodynamic contours to your truck improving MPG up to 10%.</li> <li>Sleek, smooth look not broken by arched bows in cover material improves the look of any truck.</li> <li>Top mount design works with most bed caps and liners.</li> <li>Industrial strength Velcro attaches the cover to the rails keeping it tight and taut, while reducing wear and tear.</li> <li>Simple clamp-on rails and headers requiring no drilling or cutting means installation can take as little as 20 minutes.</li> <li>Manual tension control knob requires no tools, adjusting in seconds to keep the cover tight and taut.</li> <li>Single person usability of dual latch system at the tailgate allows for quick release and roll up, while maintaining security.</li> <li>5 year warranty.</li> </ul> <b>What\'s in the Box</b><br/> All the parts needed for installation are in-box, including: passenger and driver\'s side side rails, cover assembly with safety straps and clamp assemblies, truck box header and header seals (front and back), dual latching mechanism components, manual cover tension adjustment components and all necessary hardware. <p/> <b>Limited 5-Year Warranty</b><br/> TruXedo warrants that all new, unused products and components&#151;including fabric&#151;are free from defects in material and workmanship for five years.

31311	will it fit 2014 tacoma	Catalytic converter theft is a crime that has been affecting tens of thousands of trucks, SUVs and vans across the U.S. since 2006. A catalytic converter thief will make anywhere from $50 - $100 for turning in your stolen converter to a scrap metal recycling facility, but a catalytic converter victim, may pay up to $1,500 to replace their converter. Additionally, a victim could have multiple converters on their vehicle and their vehicle could be victimized several times, causing the victim to pay out of pocket EACH TIME. The most effective way to prevent converter theft is not to 'park in a well lit area', to 'beware of your surroundings' or to 'etch your VIN # into you cat' like news articles will recommend. The #1 way to protect your converter is purchasing and installing a converter lock, like the industry-leading Catlock from Monat Technologies. The Catlock has been protecting converters since 2008 and is sold across the U.S. and U.K. It is as effective as more expensive, similar devices on the market and is simpler and takes less time to install. The Catlock and the newest model, The Catlock 2.0 which boasts 100% Grade 8 hardware and 2 aircraft quality steel cables both have a money-back guarantee. If your converter is stolen while being protected by a Catlock we will refund you the purchase price of your Catlock. So what are you waiting for? If you have a truck, van or SUV purchase a Catlock 2.0 today and sleep well tonight knowing your converter is safely beneath your vehicle and not in the hands of thieves. Order your Catlock today!

22906	Will this work alright on a plastic bathtub or would that be a bad idea?	The Heavy Duty Carpet Brush with Drill Attachment can be used to clean carpet, fabrics, upholstery, seats, wheels and much more. The high speed rotation of the drill combined with the highest quality premium heavy duty brush lifts and easily extracts spots from leather, fabric upholstery and carpet. This heavy duty brush is made of 100 percent polypropylene which is the most durable material for brushes. For best results, always wash the surface with water then spray or apply your cleanser or soap. Tilt the rotating brush at approximately 15 degrees from the vertical. Too much angle results in only a small portion of the brush being used. Too little angle or flat on the surface lessens the cleaning results and causes the brush to wobble. Wash off the surface with water, check for spots that may have been missed and repeat if necessary. Always wear face and body protection while using this drill brush. Be sure that the brush's steel insert shaft is firmly fastened in the drill chuck. Always use a properly grounded machine with a maximum RPM of 3,500.	ask_question

35171	what size do I need for a 2006 mini cooper s?	"<div class=""aplus"">', 'Thule AeroBlade roof rack bars are advanced roof rack crossbars that feature dramatically reduced noise, superior strength, total safety and an attractive aerodynamic look. AeroBlades come 43"", 47"", 53"", and 60"" bar lengths. They are compatible with a variety of Thule rack feet, including Thule Rapid Traverse, Rapid Podium, Rapid Crossroad, Rapid Tracker, Rapid Aero (sold separately). Feet slide easily onto the bars via underbar slots, while a wide variety of accessories<em>*</em> slide onto the bars via slots along the top of the bar. The wing design of the bars and WindDiffuser strips at the top and covers for underbar slots, keep wind noise to a minimum, while BoxBeam aluminum extrusion construction provides strength and a light weight. Additional features include: tape measure-free installation, and pivoting SwingBlade end caps.', 'WindDiffuser technology is a big part of the AeroBlade being one of the most quiet roof rack load bars on the market. Provided in strips that can be cut to fit around rack accessories, the textured WindDiffuser surface sits on the top-oriented T-slot cover of the AeroBlade load bars and disturbs the airflow better than a smooth surface, greatly reducing wing noise.', 'The sophisticated BoxBeam aluminum extrusion construction of AeroBlades creates one of the strongest load bars in the market. Extrusion construction creates a fixed cross-section made up of separate compartments running the length of the forged aluminum bars. Compartments have separate load-bearing vertical sections that add support to load bars. This creates incredible strength within the bars, that is not compromised by the light aluminum construction. Using a vertical load test, the AeroBlade can sustain over 800 lbs. Of force.', ""The AeroBlade contains a measuring system/component known as a SmartSlide that allows for quick, no-hassle, tape measure-free installation on rack feet. The SmartSlide is a stiff, molded T-shaped strip with measurement increments etched into its upper surface. With it users can quickly make the simple measurements that may be needed when trimming the WindDiffuser and the additional T-strips used to cover the outer edge of the underbar slot once rack feet have been slid on. Covering these slots improves aerodynamics and noise diffusion as air flows over the AeroBlade. In addition, because the SmartSlide is designed to slide along the inner edge of the underbar slot to the mounting point of rack feet, the four SmartSlides included also cover these section's open slot. This minimizes the need to trim T-strips in the primary rack application, allows AeroBlades to more easily be used on multiple vehicles, and insures that a measuring device is always available."", 'Unlike the traditional end caps of some load bar systems that must be pulled off in order to gain access to accessory mounting T-slots, AeroBlade SwingBlade end caps (four included) pivot open and closed without being removed. This pivoting action allows full access to the T-slot for easy and fast accessory installs. It also ensures that misplacement of removed end caps is never an issue.', 'Thule will warranty all Thule brand car rack systems and its accessories manufactured by Thule during the time that an original retail purchaser owns the product. This warranty terminates if a purchaser transfers the product to any other person. No warranty is given for defects caused by normal wear and tear, cosmetic rust, scratches, accidents, unlawful vehicle operation, or modification of, or any types of repair of a load carrier system other than those authorized by Thule.', ""Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since.

52420	Will this hold an XL 29er MTB?	"Your bicycle is more than just a frame, tires, handlebars and pedals. You live for what might be around that next turn, that burn in your legs as you climb a rocky trail and that freefall feeling you get as you descend a long hill. Your bike is not just a hobby; it is a gateway to the outdoors and your faithful companion in the wild. It was with this idea in mind that the CURT tray-style bike rack was built. From the BMX track to the paved trail and everything in between, bicycling is all about the ride.The CURT hitch-mounted tray-style bike rack promotes your biking experience unlike any other because of its unique, three-point support system. It is made to be easier to use and keep bikes more secure, holding them at three points of contact. Instead of hanging the bike by its crossbar, the loop-like tray-style arms cradle the bike\'s wheels, holding it securely on each end. The third point is an adjustable padded arm that slides up and down and tightens over the crossbar, keeping the entire bike firmly held in place. Both the tray arms and the vertical padded arm are highly adjustable and can fit virtually any size bike, from a giant adult mountain bike to a single-gear kids\' bike.CURT tray-style bike racks are not your average ten-speed. In fact, they are packed with features to truly make it all about the ride. They feature a hitch-mounted design to work with your vehicle\'s trailer hitch, and they come with a tilt-away feature to allow the entire rack to tilt away from the vehicle. This makes it easy to open a hatchback door or trunk and access the rear cargo area. Tray-style bike racks also feature a foldable, adjustable frame and an anti-wobble shank.Whether the road ahead is the winding course of your own personal Tour de France or the twists and turns of the forest trail, the CURT tray-style bike rack is coated in a durable powder coat finish to prevent rust and ensure a long life. This model fits 2"" receiver tubes and holds 2 or 4 bikes with the extension."	ask_question

The Porter Cable 7424XP is the safest way to restore your vehicle's paintwork by removing swirl marks and scratches while also providing the ability to apply waxes and sealants faster than ever imagined. This awesome kit comes with everything you need to get started with machine polishing.

A counterweight on the opposite side of the center spindle dampens vibration for smooth operation. The tool head action, often called orbital, prevents the creation of holograms (symmetrical buffing marks), paint burns and other forms of paint damage often associated with high-speed buffing machines. When used with proper care, the Porter Cable 7424XPs design virtually eliminates the possibility of paint damage. The polishing action of the Porter Cable 7424XP Machine Model 1000 closely mimics that of circular hand polishing. Imagine being able to make 2,500 to 6,000 tight hand circles in a single minute and youll have a pretty good idea of how the Porter Cable 7424XP Machine Model 1000 does its job. It works just like your hand, only at super-human speed! To put the beauty of this machine into complete perspective, it works 100 times faster than a super buff athlete, but it never gets tired!"	ask_question

14345	If I was to purchase a battery holder / mount for this battery (Odyssey 34M-PC1500ST), what size should I be looking for? Thanks in advance!	ODYSSEY Batteries TROLLING Thunder Marine Dual Purpose Battery (Marine Dual Terminal SAE Auto Post and Studs) has both massive starting power and amazing deep cycling capability, up to 400 cycles at 80 percentage depth of discharge. With 2 times the overall power and 3 times the life of conventional marine batteries, the ODYSSEY battery is ideal for TROLLING, starting and for powering the many on-board electronic accessories common in boats and recreational vehicles. When it comes to replacing a marine battery, boat owners have traditionally had two choices, starting or deep cycle. Often this means a compromise because most boaters want both, a marine battery that delivers robust starting power when they need it, yet also withstands deep and frequent depths of discharge without significant power loss. Unfortunately, no single battery could provide both until now. The amazing deep cycling capacity of the legendary TROLLING Thunder Battery along with massive cranking power is all in one revolutionary battery. Its construction consists of pure virgin lead plates for maximum surface area and optimized recycling, AGM design that eliminates acid spills, high conductivity, corrosion-resistant tin-plated brass terminals, high integrity terminal seal, a sealed design resulting in gases recycled internally, a self-regulating relief valve, tough flame retardant cell containers and robust internal cell connections to prevent vibration damage. Compared to spiral-wound batteries of equal size, ODYSSEY batteries pack 15 percentage more plate surface area into the case. Avoiding the dead space between cylinders in six-pack designs means ODYSSEY batteries deliver more power and 40 percentage more reserve capacity.	ask_question

Even three wire flasher relays can be replaced if one of the wires is a ground wire. We also have a new connector option on our ELFR-1 QD model (click on ELFR-1 QD tab above). This unit is guaranteed to replace any two-wire flasher relay and operate at the normal DOT blink rate for motorcycles with stock blinkers, LED blinkers, or any combination of both, provided the total load on the system is within 0.05A to 10A (0.6 Watts to 120 Watts!) - which basically covers the majority of blinker products on the market! NOTE: In some rare instances, when there are NO incandescent loads on the blinker system (LEDs front and rear), one pair of our Stage I Load Equalizers will also be required to prevent a wide range of blinker problems. These problems are all associated with a lack of resistive load on an all-LED blinker system that was designed for incandescent lamps. Problems such as, but not limited to: the 4-way blink problem (both sides blinking at the same time), the no-blink problem, and Integrated LED Tail Lights staying in ""blinker mode"" due to non-zero blinker voltages. Read more in our FAQ. Your motorcycle must have a rectified standard 12VDC system for this flasher relay to work (most bikes are 12VDC)."	ask_question

33695	What's the safest &amp; easiest way to remove the wax on a car before applying this product?	Nano-Diamond Shield is the very first product composed of 100% silica nano-particles in an aerosol suspension. Takes only 20-minutes to apply. You simply walk around the car spraying Nano-Diamond Shield on every exterior surface. No need to mask off any surface. Overspray is not harmful to anything, and will not leave any residue on soft or porous surfaces like canvas tops, and rubber. It forms a cross-linking molecular bond to all hard, non-porous surfaces such as Glass, Metal, Plastic, and Paint. Then wipe off the residue. No rubbing, no buffing. This product protects all surfaces for an entire year! GUARANTEED!!  Shiny and glossy paint for an entire year  Super Hydrophobic water beading for an entire year  Safe for all surfaces  Replaces wax, glass treatment, trim protectants, and wheel treatments  No white residue - no more scraping out dried wax from creases  Highest level of UV protection But here&apos;s the kicker - It hardens painted surfaces to 4-H and prevents swirl marks! What else does that? Fantastic for wheels because other wheel products cannot withstand the heat from brake dust particles. Nano-Diamond Shield is resistant to 500-F so hot brake dust will not burn through it to the wheels. Lots of our competitors are putting the word &quot;nano&quot; on their product because it&apos;s a nice sounding buzz word. However, none of them have any significant concentration of nano-particles in their product. If they did, they wouldn&apos;t need wax to achieve the benefits. Picture a particle so small that 50,000 of them would still be less than the width (not length) of a human hair. When you wipe off our competitor&apos;s product from the paint, you may have 100,000 nano-particles left behind over a square foot. That&apos;s two hair&apos;s worth. There is no wax in our product at all. Our product applies a full coat of nano-glass particles to the entire surface, and protects it for a year!	ask_question

Sporting a sleek black profile appearance that is not altered up by the arched bow rods inserted into the material of other tonneau covers, it is a testament to the TruXedo brand name, and is designed to add a touch of style to most any pickup truck. <p/> In addition, the TruXedo TruXport offers the best in function, providing bed protection and improved gas mileage up to 10% by way of its well-conceived aerodynamic design. Initial installation can be completed with minimal tools by virtually any Do-it-yourselfer in as little as 20 minutes with no drilling or cutting, instead utilizing a clamp system around your truck\'s box rail. Once installed, the industrial strength cover relies on a combination of Velcro closures along the top rails that are among the widest in the industry, loop and hook fasteners at the tailgate and a manual tension control system that compensates for material expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes to keep it firmly in place. Reliably tight and secure, the TruXport protects the contents of your truck bed from all weather conditions within a temperature range of -20&deg;F to well into the triple digits. Additional features include availability for a wide range of pickup models and makes, the ability to open the tailgate while the cover is on and accommodation during installation of bed liners and bed caps. <p/> <b>Simple Care and Maintenance</b><br/> The TruXedo TruXport leather grain fabric cover can be hand washed with mild soap and water or cleaned in a car wash. Owners should ensure that they thoroughly rinse the cover to remove any soap residue. The cover can also be treated with any vinyl protectant made for any tonneau cover. TruXedo recommends Pro-Tex Soft Tonneau Protectant to clean, preserve and protect TruXedo brand tonneau covers. As a rule of thumb, never use silicon, petroleum, or citrus based products on your tonneau cover. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>An affordable solution for those looking for a cover in the price range of a snap-on model, but with the features of high-end models.</li> <li>Cover height above bed rails of approximately 1&frac12;"" adds aerodynamic contours to your truck improving MPG up to 10%.</li> <li>Sleek, smooth look not broken by arched bows in cover material improves the look of any truck.</li> <li>Top mount design works with most bed caps and liners.</li> <li>Industrial strength Velcro attaches the cover to the rails keeping it tight and taut, while reducing wear and tear.</li> <li>Simple clamp-on rails and headers requiring no drilling or cutting means installation can take as little as 20 minutes.</li> <li>Manual tension control knob requires no tools, adjusting in seconds to keep the cover tight and taut.</li> <li>Single person usability of dual latch system at the tailgate allows for quick release and roll up, while maintaining security.</li> <li>5 year warranty.</li> </ul> <b>What\'s in the Box</b><br/> All the parts needed for installation are in-box, including: passenger and driver\'s side side rails, cover assembly with safety straps and clamp assemblies, truck box header and header seals (front and back), dual latching mechanism components, manual cover tension adjustment components and all necessary hardware. <p/> <b>Limited 5-Year Warranty</b><br/> TruXedo warrants that all new, unused products and components&#151;including fabric&#151;are free from defects in material and workmanship for five years.

Engines can vary widely by make and model. These instructions should be considered for general guidance only.', 'Replacing spark plugs can be a simple job, if you take things one step at a time. Given a basic understanding of mechanical matters, here&#039;s a guide to the proper procedures in changing spark plugs.', '1. Carefully remove the spark plug wires. Grasp the plug wire boot, twist about one-quarter turn to break the seal, then lift straight off. Use plug boot pullers if the boot doesn&#039;t break free easily. Number plug wires with tape as you remove them to avoid crossing them. (illus. 1)', '2. Loosen each spark plug so it can be removed. Clean the seat area with a blast of compressed air, or by blowing through a soda straw. This prevents dirt from falling into the combustion chamber when the old plugs are removed. (illus. 2)', '3. Remove the plugs and line them up in cylinder order. Inspection of the firing ends of the plugs can identify a number of engine problems that may need correction. (illus. 3)', '4. Gap new plugs as recommended in your owner&#039;s manual or a Spark Plug Catalog. Use a feeler gauge to measure the gap between the center and ground electrode. The gauge should pass through snugly but easily. If it&#039;s too loose or too tight, reset the gap.', '5. Screw new plugs in by hand until tight. If the plug starts to go in hard, use a thread chaser to clean the threads. Use a torque wrench to tighten the spark plugs following the manufacturer&#039;s recommendations, or refer to a torque chart in the Spark Plug Catalog. If you don&#039;t have a torque wrench, see the bottom of the torque chart for hand tightening recommendations.', '6. Replace spark plug wires in the correct order. Check to see if the boots are brittle or cracked, and if there is corrosion on the connector inside the boot. If any of these conditions are present, the spark plug wire should be replaced.', '7. Start the engine. If it misfires or idles roughly, the wires are crossed or not connected to the plugs correctly. Check the firing order and connections closely.	ask_question

765	Where do the temperature and compass displays appear? The photos don't show the display. Are they on the mirror surface?	"CIPA's Auto Dimming Rearview Mirror with Compass and Temperature provides the perfect solution to annoying headlight glare at night. Sensors indicate when bright lights are used and dim the mirror glass for comfort and safety. The Auto Dimming Rearview Mirror also offers a disable button for when dimming is unwanted. Additional features include a digital compass and temperature readout. The compass features a bright LED display, and is self-calibrating. The temperature feature displays outside ambient temperature, and can be programmed to display in Fahrenheit or Celsius. First time installations will require routing a power and sensor wire. Vehicles with an existing auto dimming mirror and a 7 pin connector can plug directly in with no fuss. Otherwise, the wires can be tapped using the wire tap provided. Mirror is 10 inches long by 2.5 inches tall, and is a wedge base mounting mirror. This kit includes a mirror, 6.5 ft power wire harness, wire tap, 9 wire ties, temperature sensor, 14 ft temperature sensor wire harness, operation card, wedge button, and an installation guide. Mirror mounting epoxy is not included. Hint: a camlock mount mirror is commonly found on imported vehicles and is removed by turning the mirror 90 degrees, so it is perpendicular to the dash, then pulling down on the mirror. A wedge mount mirror is commonly found on domestic vehicles and is removed by loosening a small screw or clip and pushing the mirror up toward the roof. Made in the USA and FMVSS approved under section 571.111 of Standard No. 111. Note: We do not recommend installing these mirrors if your vehicle has airbag sensors in the headliner, if your vehicle is equipped with OnStar, or if your vehicle is a hybrid model.

The menu also alerts you of any pending DTCs and reads the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) status. By reading the MIL status the scanner gives insight into what might cause your ""check engine"" light to turn on in the near future. In this way, the scanner also provides some preventive measures to help you keep a close eye on your vehicle\'s systems.

By eliminating airflow obstruction in your engine. Restriction of air flow between an air filter and an engine robs even the most powerful engine of horsepower. K&amp;N air intake kits virtually eliminate air path restriction by replacing the standard air filter and the entire air path to the engine. The aerodynamically engineered conduit that makes up the 57-3023-1 drives a massive amount of air into an engine, which translates into power. This conduit begins with an oversized conical high-flow air filter. This larger filter can fit into the engine compartment using factory holes and mounting points because the K&amp;N 57-3023-1 replaces your stock intake tube, and air box. This provides more airflow at lower restriction than a standard filter, limited by the size of the factory air box. The oversize air filter also captures and holds more dirt, increasing the service life before a cleaning is required (up to 100,000 miles). The filter is also isolated from high engine temperature by a heat shield designed to lower the temperature of the air entering the engine, which increases horsepower. <p/> The filter attaches to a rotationally molded tube made from nonmetallic interlaced high density polyethylene (HDPE). This allows for precision shaping of the tube to reduce turbulence and accelerate airflow into the engine. This is why some K&amp;N tubes have unique shapes or indentations that are specifically engineered for each engine configuration. Finally, the tube is connected to the engine with adapters made from high strength materials such as silicon and reinforced nylon and ensures long life. Put all this together and you have the best high-flow intake system available today. <p/> <b>Street Legal</b><br/> Many K&amp;N intake systems are street legal in all 50 states and include a California Air Resource Board (CARB) Executive Order (EO) number that ensures the kit has been tested to comply with emissions standards. EO numbers apply to the kit as well as the year, make and model it is being installed on. Systems with no EO number are street legal in most states but may not be used on emissions controlled vehicles in the state of California or other states adopting California emission standards. Consult K&amp;N\'s website to search by part to see which cold air intakes are CARB exempt for which vehicles. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>Guaranteed to provide increased horsepower and acceleration (15.17 hp @ 5,018 rpm measured by manufacturer).</li> <li>Engineered to specific vehicle design.

If one of these products ever fails to provide complete satisfaction, K&amp;N will replace it at their discretion. <p/> <b>About K&amp;N Engineering</b><br/> K&amp;N Engineering, of Riverside, California, is the inventor and leading innovator of reusable cotton gauze filter technology for automotive applications.

52411	The product descriprion says item weight 2.9 Pounds. Is this rack really 2.9 pounds?	"Your bicycle is more than just a frame, tires, handlebars and pedals. You live for what might be around that next turn, that burn in your legs as you climb a rocky trail and that freefall feeling you get as you descend a long hill. Your bike is not just a hobby; it is a gateway to the outdoors and your faithful companion in the wild. It was with this idea in mind that the CURT tray-style bike rack was built. From the BMX track to the paved trail and everything in between, bicycling is all about the ride.The CURT hitch-mounted tray-style bike rack promotes your biking experience unlike any other because of its unique, three-point support system. It is made to be easier to use and keep bikes more secure, holding them at three points of contact. Instead of hanging the bike by its crossbar, the loop-like tray-style arms cradle the bike\'s wheels, holding it securely on each end. The third point is an adjustable padded arm that slides up and down and tightens over the crossbar, keeping the entire bike firmly held in place. Both the tray arms and the vertical padded arm are highly adjustable and can fit virtually any size bike, from a giant adult mountain bike to a single-gear kids\' bike.CURT tray-style bike racks are not your average ten-speed. In fact, they are packed with features to truly make it all about the ride. They feature a hitch-mounted design to work with your vehicle\'s trailer hitch, and they come with a tilt-away feature to allow the entire rack to tilt away from the vehicle.

9921	Will this work with 1998 Subaru Forester S ?	"CURT class 1 trailer hitches are the lightest-duty hitches of our rear mount receiver lineup. They are engineered for reliability, welded together with quality American steel and blasted clean for a smooth finish. Tested to meet the strict demands of the industry, this CURT class 1 hitch with ball mount has a capacity to tow up to 2,000 lbs. of gross trailer weight and 200 lbs. of tongue weight. This means it can handle a variety of small trailers such as single-axle utility trailers, canoe and kayak trailers, dirt bike trailers and more. It can also accept a hitch-mounted cargo carrier or bike rack, making it a very useful addition to cars with limited cargo space (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest weight capacity of any towing component; i.e. the vehicle, hitch, trailer, etc).Class 1 hitches feature a 1 1/4"" x 1 1/4"" receiver tube opening and are typically mounted on compact cars, full-size cars and some smaller crossover SUVs, minivans and compact SUVs. This particular hitch and ball mount combination is designed to be a custom-fit trailer hitch for certain years of the Audi A5 coupe with dual muffler or Audi A5 convertible (will not fit with single muffler) (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see the CURT application guide at curtmfg.com). It features a round tube frame and comes with a hitch pin and clip and all necessary installation hardware. This class 1 hitch kit also comes with a Euro Mount ball mount, with a 1 7/8"" diameter ball, to be a complete towing package.Each CURT class 1 hitch is co-cured with a liquid Bonderite coating and a high-gloss black powder coat finish that provide a lasting defense against rust, wear and harmful UV rays.

7440	Is this the whole piece, or is it just the glass only	CIPA's Original Style Replacement Mirrors are a cost effective alternative to factory replacements of the rearview side mirrors on your vehicle. They are designed from factory tolerances to fit your vehicle like a factory piece. CIPAs Original Style Replacements Mirrors will bolt right on, with no need to modify the existing bolt-hole pattern. They have the same appearance, and meet the same quality standards needed to restore your vehicle back to its original look at a fraction of the cost. As with all CIPA mirrors, they are QS9000 & ISO 9002 certified to meet the strictest standards. They are rust and corrosion resistant, and feature OE grade glass. In order to meet the OE standard for glass, these mirrors use first surface plating, which means the reflective chrome layer is plated on the front of the glass. The advantage is less distortion from having to look through the thickness of the glass, but a greater risk from surface scratches. This mirror directly replaces original equipment number 15172247/15062880. Mirror specifications: Driver side (left hand), power remote, chrome capped, foldaway, non-heated, flat glass, with an 8 hole, 3 pin, 3 wire connector.	ask_question

26153	Where are these towels manufactured?	"This is a 36-pack of large 16"" X 16"" yellow Eurow Microfiber towels. These very soft microfiber towels will lift and trap dirt and moisture, leaving a clean, dry and polished surface. They are safe to use on all surfaces around the home, car, RV, motorcycle, aircraft, or boat. The towels are environmentally friendly in that they require little to no water, reducing waste. In addition, these microfiber towels are especially adept at cleaning without the use of chemicals. Use them dry, and they will work like magic without scratching, linting, or streaking. Use them wet and they will absorb seven to eight times their own weight in water. Microfiber works by attracting dust and other contaminants like a magnet and trapping them within its very fine microscopic filaments. The fibers are so tiny they are able to remove 99% of bacteria effortlessly. Due to their superior quality, these microfiber towels can be washed and reused hundreds of times. Care instructions: Machine wash. Tumble dry low, and do not iron. Do not use fabric softener as this would clog the microfibers and reduce performance. Do not use chlorine bleach. Wash with other non linting materials to maintain proper dirt-gripping properties."	ask_question

It is designed to be a custom-fit trailer hitch for certain years of the Toyota Highlander or Lexus RX 330, RX 350 or RX 400h hybrid (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see the CURT application guide at curtmfg.com). It features a round tube frame and comes with all necessary hardware for a complete installation.The 2"" x 2"" receiver tube opening of this class 3 hitch is able to accept a hitch-mounted accessory, such as a bike rack or cargo carrier, or a ball mount to tow most standard size trailers, including utility trailers, single-horse livestock trailers, boat trailers and large campers. One special feature about the class 3 that is not found in classes 1 or 2 is its compatibility with a weight distribution hitch. When used in combination with a WD hitch, this class 3\'s gross trailer weight capacity increases to 4,000 lbs. and the tongue weight capacity to 400 lbs. (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest weight capacity of any towing component).CURT class 3 trailer hitches are engineered to be strong and capable, having a quality steel frame and a solid finish.

13435	Can I use this for my Volvo Penta SX outdrive?	Mobil 1 Synthetic Gear Lube LS 75W-90 Mobil 1 Synthetic Gear Lube LS 75W-90 is a supreme performance, synthetic, multi-purpose, SAE 75W-90 automotive gear lubricant designed to meet the highest level of performance requirements of modern passenger vehicles in all types of operating conditions, including limited slip applications, as well as delivering outstanding power transfer performance. Compared to conventional hypoid gear lubricants, Mobil 1 Synthetic Gear Lube LS 75W-90 performs exceptionally well over a wide range of temperatures. It achieves this through a unique proprietary formulation that delivers optimized viscosity as a function of temperature properties together with the highest level of inherent formulation stability and protects against thermal and oxidative degradation, wear and corrosion, and viscosity loss associated with premature shearing. It also can be used in extended service and for aiding in fuel economy performance. It contains special friction modifiers designed for limited slip-type differentials. In most applications, the addition of special LS (limited slip) additives is not required. For axles requiring the highest level of limited-slip performance, OEM specific LS additives can be added to this fluid. It combines wax-free synthesized hydrocarbon base oils and a specially designed extreme-pressure, limited-slip, sulfur-phosphorous additive system to provide a significantly higher level of performance in rear axles and differentials versus conventional fluids. Greater film strength at higher operating temperatures, reduced fluid friction and low-temperature application down to -50 degree celsius provides significant advantages versus conventional mineral oil formulations. It reduces wear and spalling under the high speed, high torque and high horsepower conditions in competitive racing and high performance automobiles.	ask_question

The ASD valve has the ability to sense acceleration to improve the handling, safety, and overall ride characteristics of most vehicles. The ASD base valve will sense a bump in the road and automatically adjust the shock to absorb the impact, leaving the shock with greater control when it is needed. The features of the Monroe Reflex struts make it the superior choice for improved handling, safety, and comfort in all road conditions.	ask_question
30510	Does this meet VW 502 00 standards? Last one I bought had the approved manufacturer standards on the front.	"It is specifically designed for powerful and recent cars fitted with high displacement engines, gasoline direct injection and turbo Diesel and catalytic converters. Numerous car maker approvals make this product a multi-purpose and is especially recommended when the car is under warranty. Suitable for leaded or unleaded gasoline, diesel fuels and LPG. The OPEL/GM diesel LL B-025 standard requires two main properties to the lubricant such as high HTHS and very low volatility to drastically decrease oil consumption. Motul 8100 X-cess 5W-40 is especially recommended for OPEL 2.0 and 2.2 DTI engines (extended drain interval by computer on board). The ACEA B4 performance requires an outstanding detergent/dispersent power and a better viscosity increase resistance due to soot produced by direct Injection diesel engines (except VW unit injector engines that require MOTUL Specific 505.01 5W-40). The MB 229.3 standard is more stringent than 229.1 in terms of ageing resistance (extended drain interval by computer on board ), detergent/dispersent power (ACEA B4) and requests fuel economy performance where 1.2 percentage fuel economy improvement versus a 15W-40 reference.', '<div class=""aplus"">', 'Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines.  Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils.  Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process.  A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is.  Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or ""W"") performance.', ""This oil has a weight of SAE 5W-40, meaning it has an SAE viscosity rating of 5 in cold temperatures and a rating of 40 at normal operating temperature.  Always check your vehicle's owner's manual to verify that this is the correct weight of motor oil for your vehicle."", 'This oil is a full synthetic oil, meaning crude oil is not used in making it.  Synthetic oil can be used in vehicle engines instead of motor oils refined from crude oil, and often provides superior mechanical performance over traditional motor oil, including increased gas mileage and reduced engine wear at extreme temperatures.  Its complex method of production means it can often cost more than conventional motor oil."	ask_question

26357	what are the inside dimensions of the cargo area?	"Aluminum Cargo Carrier with Ramp Model - 432 ACCTG. Made in the USA This listing is for the carrier only. The cost DOES NOT include the snowblower. This NEW high quality economical carrier is ideal for transporting heavy equipment. You now have the ability to easily transport equipment or electric wheelchairs/scooters with a Sport Utility Vehicle, or any other vehicle that has a class 3 or class 4 trailer hitch. What an extremely safe operation when loading onto this low to the ground carrier, as opposed to loading equipment into a high pick-up truck bed, or trying to wrestle the equipment into the back of a SUV (if there is room). With the built-in ramp the operation is fairly simple. The ramp is bolted on and lays in the carrier when not in use. When needed lift the lightweight ramp and deploy it to the ground as it pivots on two bolts. After loading the equipment raise the ramp to an upright position and then hold it in place with a provided hitch pin and already installed bracket. This durable aluminum cargo carrier will not rust or ever need painting. Please note: anything that goes into a receiver hitch will have a little play. What you can do to eliminate the play (not really necessary though) is to tie down the equipment to the bumper on the inside (side closest to vehicle), and directly to the outside of the carrier at the opposite side (side furthest from the vehicle). This cargo carrier comes fully assembled except the 2"" square tube needs to be attached (It is detached to drastically reduce shipping charges)."	ask_question

2868	Does receiver 13323 fit a 20`14 toyota tacoma	"The CURT class 3 trailer hitch is the most common type of trailer hitch installed on full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. It is also found on full-size cars, crossover SUVs, minivans and mid-size trucks. That is because the class 3 packs the punch of a heavyweight hitch while still staying light on its feet. This CURT class 3 hitch offers a gross trailer weight capacity of 5,000 lbs. and a comparable tongue weight capacity of 500 lbs. It is designed to be a custom-fit trailer hitch for certain years of the Toyota Tacoma (including X-Runner and Pre-Runner) (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see the CURT application guide at curtmfg.com). It features a square tube frame and comes with all necessary hardware for a complete installation.The 2"" x 2"" receiver tube opening of this class 3 hitch is able to accept a hitch-mounted accessory, such as a bike rack or cargo carrier, or a ball mount to tow most standard size trailers, including utility trailers, single-horse livestock trailers, boat trailers and large campers. One special feature about the class 3 that is not found in classes 1 or 2 is its compatibility with a weight distribution hitch. When used in combination with a WD hitch, this class 3\'s gross trailer weight capacity increases to 5,500 lbs. and the tongue weight capacity to 550 lbs. (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest weight capacity of any towing component).CURT class 3 trailer hitches are engineered to be strong and capable, having a quality steel frame and a solid finish. They are put through strenuous testing before being deemed ready for market and come with two coatings -- a liquid Bonderite coating and a powder coat in high-gloss black -- that cure together to form a strong resistance against rust, scratching, UV damage and other wear.

30685	Has anybody used this in a 2014 Dodge Ecodiesel? Problems?	Diesel exhaust fluid is one of the key elements of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process used by most medium and heavy-duty engine builders to meet EPA 2010 regulations. BlueDEF is a non-toxic solution of 67.5 percent purified water and 32.5 percent ultra pure automotive grade urea. BlueDEF is not a fuel or fuel additive. Instead, when injected into the exhaust stream and passed over a catalyst, BlueDEF helps convert NOx into nitrogen gas and water vapor, two harmless and natural components of the air. BlueDEF is stable, colorless and odorless, and meets ISO Standards 22241 for purity and composition and is an American Petroleum Institute (API) certified diesel exhaust fluid. These are the highest quality and safety standards in place to ensure optimum SCR performance. Making sure you do not run out of BlueDEF in a SCR equipped truck is simple, watch the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) gauge, which is part of the diesel fuel gauge, for when it is time to refill. DEF is stored in a dedicated tank next to the fuel tank on the driver's side. The tanks range in size from 6 to 23 gallons depending on the truck's application. The DEF tank fill opening is designed to accommodate a DEF fill nozzle to ensure only DEF is put into the tank. A diesel fuel nozzle will not fit into the DEF tank opening.	ask_question

They are fabricated from a high quality material that features the trilingual menu of English, Spanish and French offering the SD card slot and allows memory expansion. These tools are equipped with True Bi-Directional capabilities, graphing data, acronym and code library lookup, retaining the most recently scanned vehicle data and configuration. They are enhanced with color-coded cables which have the capacity to enter more than one feature with user programmable hot key. These tools are easy to maintain and are supported by OBDII code command.', 'Today\'s automobile is as much a product of the modern age as any personal computer. Wired with networks of on-board computers designed to optimize efficiency and proper functioning using standardized Onboard Diagnostics (OBDs), they churn out Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) intended to alert drivers and technicians of potential problems. Professional garages use expensive diagnostic scanners to decipher these codes, but there is another way to get the job done.

Loaded with easy to use diagnostic software, constructed of tough, gripable plastic and coming complete with a rugged carrying case, an assortment of color-coded, OBD-specific cables and a deep array of features, it is designed to put the ability to read, record and playback live sensor data, trouble codes and their definitions in the palm of your hand.<p/> <b>Diagnostics Right Out of the Box: OBD-I, OBD-II and Beyond</b><br/> The AX7000 offers an extensive range of diagnostics possibilities, including access to diagnostic codes and datastreams ranging from GM, Ford and Chrysler OBD-I codes (1982 - 1995), all OBD-II enhanced codes (1996 and newer), GM, Ford and Chrysler enhanced OBD-II datastream (1996 - 2006) and enhanced OBD-II code commands for Toyota, Nissan and Honda models. In addition to this, the unit also ships loaded with software containing many other useful functions such as graph data (1984 - 1995), an acronym library, an O2 monitor test, extensive bi-directional test functionality, a diagnostic monitor test, the ability to print directly from the scanner via a USB cable, multiple feature launching through programmable hot keys and much more.<p/> <b>Upgrade Options: SD Memory Cards and the Internet</b><br/> Too often diagnostic tools are created with an overly narrow purpose, forcing consumers to buy a different tool for each job. As a reaction to this, the AX7000 was designed to offer something rarely seen in a tool in its price range, upgrade options both attractive and easy. First, to take advantage of its long history in the diagnostic tool industry, AutoXray has ensured that the AX7000 is Internet updatable, allowing AX7000 owners to both upload software shipped with previous AutoXray scanners for a nominal fee, as well as the latest versions of the AX7000 software. More importantly, the AX7000 SD memory card slot allows owners to upgrade their scanner with specific definitions, codes and datastreams as they are released. A regular release schedule of upgrades has been established for the near future which will include SD cards and any necessary cables. Through this groundbreaking release strategy, owners can customize their AX7000 tools with additional upgrades as they need them, without having to pay for unnecessary hardware or features.<p/> <table align=right width=250 cellpadding=10>   <tr>      <td height=""194"">       <div align=""center""><img alt=""AutoXray AX7000 side SD memory slot"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/auto/detail-page/B001LJIZHO.02.sm.jpg"" border=0 align=top width=""225"" height=""535""><br>         <small></small></div>       <small> <center>         <b><i>Easy, affordable upgrades <br/> via the SD memory slot.</i></b>        </center></small>  </td>   </tr> </table> <b>Product Features</b>:  <ul>  <li>SD card slot (allows for inexpensive tool upgrades and memory expansion).</li>  <li>GM, Ford and Chrysler Enhanced OBD-I codes and datastream.</li>  <li>GM, Ford and Chrysler Enhanced OBD-II codes.</li>  <li>Enhanced OBD-II code command on Toyota, Nissan and Honda.</li>  <li>Graph data (1996 and newer vehicles).</li>  <li>Ability to read, record and playback live sensor data.</li>  <li>Acronym and code library lookup.</li>     <li>True bi-directional capabilities.</li>     <li>Trilingual on-screen menu and written quickstart manual (English, Spanish, French).</li>  <li>Larger backlit screen 128 x 128 pixel size ~50% larger.</li>     <li>Internet updatable</li>  <li>Overmolding of scanner body for better grip and more durable tool.</li>  <li>Dynamic language switching.</li>  <li>Ability to print directly to USB printer.</li>  <li>Color-coded cables.</li>  <li>Ability to enter more than one feature with user programmable hot key.</li>  <li>Battery powered (6 x AA batteries).</li>  <li>USB port on tool for connection with PC.</li>     <li>OBD-I cables for domestic vehicles (GM, Ford and Chrysler 1982-95).</li>  <li>Hard carrying case.</li> </ul> <b>What\'s in the Box</b><br/> The AutoXray AX7000 TechScan Kit contains: techScan base unit, OBD-II cable, GM OBD-I ALDL cable, Ford OBD-I MCU/EEC-IV cable, Chrysler OBD-I SCI cable, USB cable, 6-foot extension cable, cigarette lighter adapter, vehicle battery adapter, blow molded hard case, trilingual quickstart manual (English, Spanish and French).<p/> <b>About AutoXray, Inc.</b><br/> AutoXray, Inc., a division of SPX Service Solutions, is a leading provider of effective, affordable diagnostic equipment to both amateur and professional automotive technicians.

28103	What gauge of wire should I use? Is 0GA overkill, I have leftovers. As well should it be placed in the middle or closer to one battery?	A smart isolator is the ultra-simple and most technologically advanced method of automatic battery isolation. These units can be installed between batteries with a common ground to automatically control the charging process to the batteries but continue to provide isolation when a charging source is unavailable. The small size and rugged construction of these units allow for quick simple installation for even the most novice DIYer. The smart isolator is also Dual Sensing which senses the charge of both batteries. If either battery is receiving a charge, e.g. a battery charger is connected to the auxiliary battery; the relay will engage and charge both batteries. The advanced technology always insures that the first battery is fully charged (13.4v) before connection is made to the second battery. This prevents problems that may result from your charging source being too low in amps to charge all batteries as once. If placed in linear sequence between each battery the isolator units can provide proper charging for several batteries in a multiple battery setup such as in larger boats that may have 2 or more house batteries. How it works: The smart isolator allows two batteries to be charged at the same time. When the engine is started and either battery reaches 13.4 volts, the relay engages, allowing two battery banks (start and accessory) to be charged simultaneously. When the voltage drops below 12.9 volts (eg the engine is stopped), the relay disengages, separating the batteries. This system eliminates the possibility of draining the start battery and protects sensitive electronic equipment powered from the house battery from harmful engine start up spikes.	ask_question

28012	I see in the product information that this remp requires a Lithium Metal battery. Why is there a battery required for this ramp??	Need some extra room to access your low profile vehicle? With our 2 piece 56 inch Race Ramps, we made it happen by breaking the ramp in two. It's a little innovation of ours that lets you get underneath and around your low profile or low clearance vehicle safely and easily. Simply drive up the ramp and, once your vehicle is firmly chocked in place, remove the sloped section. There you go -- easy and safe access to your low profile car for oil changes, tune ups, detailing or accessing the suspension components. Our 2 piece 56 inch Race Ramps have all the advantages of our 1 piece models with a bit more flexibility and mobility thrown in. (These bad boys will even fit in the trunk of a C-5 Corvette!) And don't forget. Our 2 piece 56 inch Race Ramps are sturdy, solid and Unscootable, hugging the ground and never slipping or sliding no matter the surface -- dirt, wet cement, garages or even ice! (We've got a trip planned to see if they work on the surface of Mars.) And if you're working in the garage or in the driveway, like all Race Ramps, our 2 piece 56 inch Race Ramps won't dig into, scratch or blemish your floors. They come complete with straps, too, for easy carrying and storage, or for putting in your trunk. Looking to buy a used car? Bring them along to get a look at the bottom side.

5603	What is the size of the nut? They say 17 mm in the description but others state it's 1 inch. That would be more like 25 mm.	"Originally developed for demanding auto race applications, our premium oil filter is rapidly becoming a favorite among consumers for its durability and easy removal. We've changed oil filters and several of our product development technicians are sportsman class drag racers. They insisted we offer an oil filter that corrected the headaches they experienced over the years changing oil filters.We have all been there: Whether it's remembering where that disappearing canister tool is; or having oil leak all over your garage and yourself; or finally giving up and pounding a screwdriver through the filter just to get if off. Each of our automotive and marine oil filters comes with a 1 nut welded to the top of the canister so they can be easily wrenched-off with a standard tool. Our motorcycle and ATV oil filters come with a 17 mm nut. Our oil filters use resin impregnated cellulose filter media. This allows for higher flow rates while providing outstanding filtration. High filter flow rates are important in racing vehicles where heavier grade oil is used and the oil is pumped much faster than in a standard vehicle. When the engine is circulating oil at high GPM rates, the high-flow oil filter helps reduce the loss of pressure through the filtering process. To satisfy the demands of racers, our oil filter has many features over and above the requirements of most vehicles. We use thicker canister walls for extra strength and durability which reduces the risk of damage from loose rocks and debris. The heavy-duty construction will withstand higher oil pressures found only in racing environments without bursting. The drilled hole on the nut is for a safety wire attachment. Required for many types of racing, the safety wire prevents blown oil filters from falling on the track and representing a hazard to other race vehicles. This extra engineering offers peace of mind for consumers who want only the best."", 'K&amp;N Premium Wrench-Off Oil Filters are specially designed for high durability and high flow rates in extreme conditions. Each oil filter comes with a hex nut welded to the top of the canister so it can be easily wrenched-off with a standard tool. An Anti-drain back valve (where applicable) keeps oil in the engine to help prevent dry starts and rolled threads help prevent stripping and give a smoother installation.', '<img alt=""oil filter K&amp;N"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/fc639e95-027f-4839-ba1c-dc142ec091b9.jpg._CB300978511__SR220,220_.jpg"" />', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/64bd76d5-adcc-4dc0-9d5f-ad093c72cff5.jpg._CB300978643__SR220,220_.jpg"" />', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/090ca598-6d1c-4304-a34b-ce01657e86b5.jpg._CB300978585__SR220,220_.jpg"" />', '<img alt="""" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0e9628f9-a0dd-443b-ac23-2ae17cfe9250.jpg._CB300978246__SR220,220_.jpg"" />"	ask_question

2706	i want to use this hitch for a 12000 winch on my 2006 crew cab super duty,is this hitch strong enough?	"CURT front mount trailer hitches allow you to use the front end of your vehicle for various towing applications. They can be used for mounting a winch, a snow plow, a number of hitch-mounted accessories and can even be used for some towing applications. When space is limited, a front hitch is commonly used to hold a cargo carrier, freeing up space inside the vehicle for extra cargo and making the rear mount receiver available to pull a trailer. At the boat ramp, your boat trailer can be hitched up to the front hitch receiver, giving you better control over the trailer as you launch. Some of the other accessories that can be used with a front mount hitch are the CURT step pad, license plate holder, spare tire mount and skid shield.A front mount hitch bolts onto the underside of the vehicle frame just like a rear mount hitch; only, it is placed in the front of the vehicle, providing a useful receiver tube to accept a 2"" x 2"" shank. They are commonly used on trucks, vans and SUVs. This CURT front mount trailer hitch features a gross trailer weight capacity of 5,000 lbs. and a tongue weight capacity of 500 lbs. It is designed to be a custom-fit trailer hitch for certain years of the Ford Excursion with 2WD or 4WD, Ford F250 or F250 Super Duty with 2WD or 4WD, Ford F450 Super Duty cab and chassis with 34"" frame or Ford F550 Super Duty cab and chassis with 34"" frame (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see the CURT application guide at curtmfg.com).

By eliminating airflow obstruction in your engine. Restriction of air flow between an air filter and an engine robs even the most powerful engine of horsepower. K&amp;N air intake kits virtually eliminate air path restriction by replacing the standard air filter and the entire air path to the engine. The aerodynamically engineered conduit that makes up the 57-3010-1 drives a massive amount of air into an engine, which translates into power. This conduit begins with an oversized conical high-flow air filter. This larger filter can fit into the engine compartment using factory holes and mounting points because the K&amp;N 57-3010-1 replaces your stock intake tube, and air box. This provides more airflow at lower restriction than a standard filter, limited by the size of the factory air box. The oversize air filter also captures and holds more dirt, increasing the service life before a cleaning is required (up to 100,000 miles). The filter is also isolated from high engine temperature by a heat shield designed to lower the temperature of the air entering the engine, which increases horsepower. <p/> The filter attaches to a rotationally molded tube made from nonmetallic interlaced high density polyethylene (HDPE). This allows for precision shaping of the tube to reduce turbulence and accelerate airflow into the engine. This is why some K&amp;N tubes have unique shapes or indentations that are specifically engineered for each engine configuration. Finally, the tube is connected to the engine with adapters made from high strength materials such as silicon and reinforced nylon and ensures long life. Put all this together and you have the best high-flow intake system available today. <p/> <b>Street Legal</b><br/> Many K&amp;N intake systems are street legal in all 50 states and include a California Air Resource Board (CARB) Executive Order (EO) number that ensures the kit has been tested to comply with emissions standards. EO numbers apply to the kit as well as the year, make and model it is being installed on. Systems with no EO number are street legal in most states but may not be used on emissions controlled vehicles in the state of California or other states adopting California emission standards. Consult K&amp;N\'s website to search by part to see which cold air intakes are CARB exempt for which vehicles. <p/> <b>Key Features</b>: <ul> <li>Guaranteed to provide increased horsepower and acceleration (18.29 hp @ 5,331 rpm measured by manufacturer).</li> <li>Engineered to specific vehicle design.

22478	The Manual doesn't explain what a flashing light means on the controller. Can you please explain (and add to future manuals)?	The Oxford Heaterz ATV is a pair of heated handlebar grips made especially for ATV's with a grip design that fits the majority of ATV's, but can be cut down in length if required. It has many tried and tested features such as the silicon cables which provide flexibility in the coldest weathers and the winter grade wiring prevents cracking and short circuits; the bonded grip design has been in use for many years and is well proven; the grip compound and thermo plastic rubber construction is designed to absorb vibration making them extremely comfortable and durable, often outlasting standard grips and the silicone wires that come from the grip are angled to eliminate water ingress and resulting corrosion/ice damage and have special unique internal supports which are heat shrunk together to prevent damage if the wires are snagged. In addition, four carefully chosen heat settings allow the perfect temperature to be selected in all weathers and most importantly, the switch will switch off if the voltage drops to 10.5 Volts to ensure that the battery is not damaged to the point that it cannot be recharged to full capacity. With the Heaterz range, Oxford have also eliminated complex issues like bike noise interference that commonly affects switch mode equipment ensuring that Oxford Heaterz work reliably on a diverse range of motorcycles and scooters. You'll find everything supplied by Oxford to fit your Heaterz from a wiring loom with ring connectors to the battery with simple plug and play connectors to attach to the switch and grips, smart mounting bracket and switch right down to the glue and cable ties all neatly packaged in one box.	ask_question
